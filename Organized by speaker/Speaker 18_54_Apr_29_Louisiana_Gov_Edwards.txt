We know the importance of testing. We can’t treat what we don’t find. And early on we knew that we had a problem and we knew that we needed to surge our testing. And so we were grateful to have that support, especially in the epicenter in New Orleans, in the parishes right around there so that we could get a sense of, of what’s going on with COVID. And then we’ve continued that pattern through the rest of the state.
