Thank you Mr president. I’m John Nims with US Cotton and we are the company that is going to produce the swabs to be used in these testing kits. We have about 1200 people in our company and in our Cleveland operation they have pivoted from… As you’ve said, the Q-tip style swab to a swab that’s going to have a plastic stick with a polyester tip so that they can be assembled into these kits. Our Cleveland team has done a wonderful job with this and they’re very excited to be able to help in this effort. So thank you mr president.
