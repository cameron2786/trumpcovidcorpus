Oh, thank you. Thank you, Mr President and Mr. Vice President. Today, you heard a wonderful announcement from the FDA and I just want to give a shout out to Steve, Dr. Hahn and the folks at the FDA whereabout, where several hundred of my commission corps officer’s work. You’re right, Mr. President, they are tireless. They’re doing things that have never been done before to bring the most prudent advances to the American people.

But, I want to talk about something different briefly. We know many of you are home practicing the president’s guidelines for social distancing. But one thing we should all consider, especially our millennials and Gen Z, is donating blood.

As an anesthesiologist who still practices at Walter Reed taking care of our wounded warriors and our soldiers, I know donated blood is an essential part of caring for patients, and one donation can save up to three lives.

Blood centers are open now and in need of your donation. I want America to know that blood donation is safe and blood centers are taking extra precautions at this time based on new CDC recommendations, including spacing beds six feet apart, disinfecting surfaces between patients, temperature checking staff, and encouraging donors to make appointments ahead of time, so we can space them out. Social distancing does not have to mean social disengagement, so give blood, today. You’ll feel good about it, and you’ll be helping your country and your community during this crisis and you might even save a life.
