Brian, you’ve been fantastic and Bank of America has been incredible. You were right up there right at the beginning. We appreciate it. You probably noticed I mentioned your name a few times two days ago when it all started. We appreciate it very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
<02:21>
Really great job. Goldman Sachs, a friend of mine for a long time David Solomon, please David. Go ahead.

Visa CEO, Al Kelly.
<20:07>
Thank you very much Al, and bringing back the travel is going to be a very big thing. We’re working with the airlines and we’re going to bring them back. I guess they need help, Steve, at a high level. But we’re going to bring them back. They’re ready to go. So thank you very much for what you said, and for the great job you do, Al. Citibank.
<20:27>
How are you, Michael? Hi.
<20:32>
It’s good, Mike.
<20:35>
Great job you’re doing. Thank you.
<22:59>
Yeah. Great job. Thank you very much, Michael. We appreciate it. Really a wonderful job you’ve done. Remember when banking used to be a nice simple business? Fellas, you remember that? Nice and simple. Not simple anymore is it? Thank you very much Michael.

The Community Spirit Bank CEO, Brad Bolton.
<26:16>
Well, Brad, that’s really nice. I think you’re the only banker that will pray for me daily. But I’m not too sure about some of those New York guys sitting there, if they pray for me. But they like me, but I don’t know if they pray for me, so I appreciate that very much, Brad. Michael, you’re up. MasterCard. Terrific job.
<29:34>
Well that’s fantastic Michael. I appreciate it and that really is very generous. It’s going to be very good for you, too. We really appreciate it. Thank you.
<29:44>
This is the last and then we’re going to say a few closing remarks. And Live Oak Bank and Chip Mahan, is Chip there? Chip? Live Oak?
<30:08>
I think they’re too busy. Yeah. They’re doing a lot of loans. That’s all right. We’ll miss them desperately. Everybody wants to hear about Live Oak. But thank you, anyway Chip. Good job. Saved us a little time. I want to finish off, just I want to ask Ivanka to say a few remarks and then Steve and then I’ll say something. But we really appreciate what you’re doing. Ivanka, please.
<31:11>
Thank you, honey, very much. Steve?
<31:31>
Thank you very much Steve. An incredible job, and I hope the media here can see what an incredible job the banks have done. All of the people we’ve just heard from have done, and that the Treasury and all of you as small business, you’ve never been so busy in your life. You’re setting records every day. But it’s really a tribute to government, really well run government. And there are few glitches, very few. Any little glitch we had worked out within minutes, within hours. And there were a couple of little applications and they wanted to work it a little bit differently. Bank had some suggestions and it was all done, probably, I would say 100% of it in the first day. I just want to congratulate everybody. This has become so popular. It’s so good for business. It’s so good for our country and it’s the engine of our country. Small business is the engine. They need a little help and we’re going to give them a little help and it’s going to be good for you all. So it’s good for our country, that makes it good for you.
<32:29>
So I just want to thank you, your friends. So many friends up there. I’m looking at this beautiful screen, and so many familiar faces and people I respect and very much admire. And just keep up the great work and anytime you’d like, I’m here. I’m in the White House. I suggest maybe that in about a month from now, maybe when things calm down a little bit with respect to our hidden enemy, Steve, will set up a meeting and we’ll meet with some of the banks and discuss what we can do for you to make it just go. Not just this program, but other programs that you want or that you have, or if you have ideas for us to make the country hum. And that’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to make it hum. So if you think of some ideas, whether it’s a month or two months we’ll, we’ll meet at the White House and it’ll be a very productive meeting. So Steve will set it up. Thank you all very much. Congratulations on the success. Thank you.
<33:21>
Thank you, very much.
<33:28>
Thank you very much.
<33:31>
Thank you everybody. Thank you. Okay. Please.
<33:34>
Thanks. Thanks. Okay. Yes?
<33:47>
Oh, it’s moving now.
<34:05>
Totally separate.
<34:13>
Just shows you though how positive it is. I mean, they’re looking at a unanimous vote and that’s something. And we’re talking about, we’re negotiating a phase four. We’ll see how that all works out. But this would be separate.
<34:27>
But we’re going to have a news conference in a couple of minutes, so we’ll do that. Okay?
<34:35>
I know all about it. We’ll talk about it at the press conference.
<34:39>
I want this … I’d like you to focus on this because this has really been a tremendous success. And then what we’re going to do is we’re going to have a press conference at about 5:00, 5:15, and we’ll talk about that.
