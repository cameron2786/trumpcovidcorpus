Mr. President, before you leave, on what John was saying, you’ve called for people to leave politics out of this. Joe Biden said the World Health Organization offered testing kits that they had available to the United States and they’d give it to us now. We refused it. We didn’t want to buy them. PolitiFact says the WHO never made that offer. Can you tell us what actually happened?
