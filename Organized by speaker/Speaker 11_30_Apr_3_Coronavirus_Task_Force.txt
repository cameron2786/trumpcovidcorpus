Thank you. Yesterday Jared Kushner said the notion of the federal stockpile was, it’s supposed to be our stockpile. It’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use. What did he mean by our?
<47:45>
Even the fact that taxpayers from every state pays for it.
<47:50>
No, it’s not a got you.
<47:52>
What about the states?
<48:02>
So why did you say it’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use?
<48:12>
To give to the states.
<48:14>
Then who are you giving it to if it’s not to the states?
<48:37>
He makes a distinction, and sir-
<48:45>
It’s not bad. I’m just trying to understand.
<48:47>
No, by the way, Secretary Azar-
<49:07>
Maybe just even change the language on the website.
<49:13>
You didn’t give me an answer.
