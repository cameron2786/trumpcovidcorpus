Thank you, Mr. President. Guy Reschenthaler from Pennsylvania. I just want to thank you and the administration for holding China accountable. I think for way too long, no one’s held China accountable. And the fact that we’re looking into the World Health Organization and how they really work hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party to cover this virus up in the early days, is absolutely shameful. So thank you for bringing attention to that.

In Pennsylvania, we’re having a really hard time because the governor has had such draconian shut down measures. We’re now number one in unemployment claims, but we’re only number five in terms of population. Instead of protecting the most vulnerable in nursing homes, where you had 65% of the deaths if not more in Pennsylvania, he had a draconian measure, one-size- fits-all approach, that lacked any kind of nuance and it’s destroying our economy, while at the same time leaving the most vulnerable exposed to this virus. So thanks for calling out the governors that are going too far with this and calling for America and Congress to go back to work.
