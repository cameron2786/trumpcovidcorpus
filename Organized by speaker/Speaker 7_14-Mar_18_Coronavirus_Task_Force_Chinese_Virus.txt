So trying to clarify something, because just a week ago, you all were standing here telling us that unless you had sustained contact with somebody who is symptomatic for COVID 19, you really didn’t need to worry. You told the president, the vice president, that if they shook hands with somebody who had this, if they took a photograph with somebody who had this, he didn’t really need to worry, and yet, several days later, we’re in a situation where people are being told, “Don’t leave your houses.” There are curfew saying, “You can not walk alone at night after a certain time.” Can you walk us through what seems like a very dramatic swing, a very dramatic disconnect from what we were hearing before to what we’re hearing now.
