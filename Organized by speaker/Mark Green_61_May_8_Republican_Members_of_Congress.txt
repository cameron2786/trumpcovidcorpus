Mr. President, Mark Green from Tennessee. Great to see you again.

Thanks for your leadership. This COVID-19 thing has been unprecedented. It’s a challenge to both the world and the United States, our country. A challenge made worse by China in the delays in information to us, the deception. China lied and people died. And as an infantry officer, an ER physician, former business CEO, I know that when a leader is caught in an ambush, that leader has to make split second decisions with the information that they have. Mr. President, I’m proud of the decisions that you have made. Decisions like banning travel from China, which these guys all laughed at and criticized, but it saved American lives. Sir, you saved American lives with those decisions. And we in Tennessee, we thank you for that. We’re opened up for business. We’re going to the restaurants and business is running again. We’re ready to lead and we appreciate your phased plan. We’re implementing it in Tennessee. Thank you for your leadership, sir.

Mr. President, you put that ban in place before they even named the virus. You saved American’s lives. Thank you.
