Yeah. You mentioned that I think you used the term clear scientific benchmarks on testing and the main periscope that I think you guys are talking about is the IOL syndromic as well as the surveillance in the Sentinel testing. I just want to be clear, are you opening things up without doing widespread testing? Is that because you don’t have the capacity or you don’t think it’s necessary?
