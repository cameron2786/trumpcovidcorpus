Mr. President, getting back to Peter’s question, a variation of that question., Your doctors who are gathered here seem to be in doubt as to whether or not the country could reopen on May the 1st, if they come to you before May the 1st and say the country is not ready or huge parts of the country are not ready to reopen on May the 1st will you listen to them?

Some of your allies have been bashing these doctors, would you tell them to cut it out?
<54:13>
If they come back to you sir and say “Before may the 1st we can’t open on May the 1st, do you listen?

Thank you. Mr. President, you may have seen this, but JP Morgan came out with a forecast about GDP growth in the second quarter and they’re saying a 40% decline in the second quarter of this year. Do your economic advisors share that view?
