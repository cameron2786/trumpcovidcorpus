Thank you, Mr. President. The question for Dr. Birx, quickly. I’m trying to understand what we… It’s about the mortality rate. Yesterday, we underlined the fact that we had reached a hundred deaths, and this morning we wake up and we’re at 110. Within 12 hours, we climbed by 10%. is it something we have to expect from now on, a 10% increase every 12 hours?
