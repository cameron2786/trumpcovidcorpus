Thank you, Mr. President. I’m greatly honored to be here to represent my fellow postal employees as we continue to provide our essential services to America. Customers often tell us during difficult times that seeing us out every day gives them a sense of normalcy in their life. The gratitude we are receiving from our customers is greatly inspiring and the thank-you notes along our routes are helping us get through. We’re delivering a lot of essential items at this time. The amount of medicine has greatly increased. Customers depend on us for social security checks and other financial information. Since this material mail-in ballots and then essential items that they’re ordering online. At the postal service, we’re continuing to follow CDC guidelines to keep ourselves and our customers safe. Social distancing, wearing a face mask, lots of hand washing, and the cleaning of our vehicles and facilities. I’m very proud to work for the postal service and to deliver for our country.
