Thank you, Mr. vice president. Let me begin by on behalf of all of the officials at HHS and our whole team’s expressing our sadness for the loss of this patient in the state of Washington. Any single death for us is a real tragedy and our sympathy to her family and our solidarity with all those who are and will suffer from the novel coronavirus. From day one, this is what we predicted, this is what we expected. The risk to any average American is low from the novel coronavirus. The risk remains low thanks to the unprecedented actions President Trump has taken and the actions he’s announcing today. That risk remains low, but this can change rapidly.

We have always said, from the first moment that we have spoken about this, that we would see more cases. We are seeing more cases. We will see more cases, but it’s important to remember, for the vast majority of individuals who contract the novel coronavirus, they will experience mild to moderate symptoms and their treatment will be to remain at home, treating their symptoms the way they would a severe cold or the flu. For some individuals, a smaller percentage, especially those who may be medically fragile, they will require medical attention including possibly hospitalization.
