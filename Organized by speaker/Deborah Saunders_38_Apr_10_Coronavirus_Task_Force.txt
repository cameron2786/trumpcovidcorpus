Well, thank you. Mr. President. I’m Deborah Saunders of the Las Vegas Review Journal and I’m here today as a print reporter, a print pooler. So I’d like to ask you a question and then ask a question from one of the reporters who couldn’t be here because of social distancing.
<01:29:40>
Thank you.
<01:29:42>
Thank you. I was wondering if you have been tested for antibodies, if you’ve taken the antibody test?
<01:29:49>
Yes.
<01:29:51>
Has anybody else been tested?
<01:29:54>
Has anybody else on the task force been tested for antibodies?

Okay, good to know. So this question is from Andrew Feinberg with Newsweek. A significant amount of federal aid was made available to Boeing in the recently signed Cares Act relief package. But according to sources, Boeing executives are still planning a round the layoffs. Should Boeing or any company that accepts federal aid, to stay in business during this pandemic be penalized for laying off workers after doing so?
