Well, from the CDC guidance, been very clear that from the beginning of this outbreak, for anyone that comes into contact with someone with Coronavirus, we, early on recommended that people self quarantine. That recommendation, of course, was before we had done at this point, some 7.7 million tests around the country in states like Texas, are distributing tests very quickly to people that, either have symptoms or are suspected to possibly have contracted the Coronavirus.

But with regard to essential workers, the president referred to, we’ve always had an exception. People to keep food on the table, people that are involved in public safety, most especially healthcare workers. We’ve asked them to continue to go to work by taking other counter measures and including testing to ensure that they’ve not contracted the disease. And as the president indicated, the White House now has initiated an effort that the president and I not only will be tested every day, but I think everyone that comes into contact with the president will be tested every day. And so, keeping the essential work here at the White House moving forward in our national response is the priority going forward.
