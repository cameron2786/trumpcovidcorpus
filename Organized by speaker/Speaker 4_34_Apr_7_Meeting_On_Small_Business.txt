Mr. President, how quickly can you move on that?

Mr. President-
<33:45>
How quickly can you move on that $250 billion supplemental?
<33:58>
And would that be in addition to a second round of direct payments separate?
<34:05>
So how quickly would that move?
<34:27>
And also Mr. President-
<34:30>
Very quickly, did you see Peter Navarro’s memo that he wrote warning about the Coronavirus on January 29th?
<34:38>
Can you tell us if you saw it?
<34:49>
For the evening news casts though, Mr. President-
<35:08>
Thank you.
