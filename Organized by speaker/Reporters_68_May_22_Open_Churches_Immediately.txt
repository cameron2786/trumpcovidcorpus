Couple of questions to follow up on the President’s announcement. First, just to clarify, he came out and said, “I’m calling upon governors to allow churches and places of worship to open up right now.” Dr. Birx just said, in areas where they have high cases of COVID-19, maybe they should think about waiting a week. So which is it, and why the mixed messaging?
<35:15>
The President said he’s going to override the governors. Under what authority would he do that? And to your point, he said several weeks ago, this is all up to the governors.
<35:29>
No, he said he would override the governors.
<35:42>
<crosstalk 00:35:42> The President stood there and said if governors don’t listen to him, he’s going to override their authority.
<35:52>
<crosstalk 00:35:52> what authority would he use to override governors?
<36:10>
But just, what authority is the President referencing here?
<36:13>
Kayleigh, does the White House now support these churches that are defying governors orders in opening up?
<36:32>
But if a governor does not allow that, does the White House support churches defying these executive orders?
<36:41>
So the answer is yes?
<36:46>
Just to follow up what Kristen asked… What specific provision of federal law allows the President to override a governor’s decision?
<37:06>
No, but the President said that he <crosstalk 00:37:00>.
<37:06>
Kayleigh, I object to that. I mean, I go to church. I’m dying to go back to church. The question that we’re asking you, and would like to have asked the President and Dr. Birx is, is it safe? And if it’s not safe, is the President is trying to encourage that, or does the President agree with Dr. Birx that people should wait?
<38:03>
And we celebrate that too. I just want to follow up by saying we celebrate that too. Certainly the First Amendment part-
<38:11>
But we’re not asking you if the President or people are allowing Americans to pray. That’s not the question.
<38:43>
Thank you, Kayleigh. I’d like to switch gears, asking about President Obama. We had an interesting article from Joel Pollak this morning. And I would like to ask you if the President has considered pardoning President Obama for illegally wiretapping on Trump Towers, illegally spying on US citizens, and other potential crimes out there. Has he considered that?

But Michael Flynn’s name wasn’t matched to-

Kayleigh. Kayleigh.
