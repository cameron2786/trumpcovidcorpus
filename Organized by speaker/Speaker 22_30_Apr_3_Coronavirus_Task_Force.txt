Thank you very much. I think I just want to reemphasize, I’ve said this before, that we’re not defenseless against this virus. We have a powerful tool, a powerful weapon that is social distancing and we’ve continued to embrace that with the president’s initiatives to slow the spread of coronavirus. We’re constantly looking at new data. And as the surgeon general said, one of the new information that became more clear to all of us is there’s a greater number of people that are asymptomatically infected than we previously thought.

And as Ambassador Birx said, that may be inversely related to age. And so really the purpose here is first and foremost to embrace the social distancing. That’s the number one thing. That’s the powerful weapon. And this virus has a great weakness. It can’t jump from one person to another if it’s got to swim more than six feet. And this is why we really want that. That said, we now know that there may be individuals in areas of significant community transmission that may be asymptomatically infected. And we know that a face barrier can actually interrupt the number of virus particles that can go for one person to the other.

So as was said by the vice president and the president, the purpose of this face covering is to be another adjunctive mitigation strategy to protect someone from spreading the virus from themself to someone else.
