Can I just follow up on sort of your modeling. Everyone’s talking about this Neil Ferguson study out of Imperial and how the modeling’s changed. You, last week, said… or it was on Monday that you talked about a serology test, something promising coming out of Singapore. Where are we on a serology test? The President said very quickly. And then, is that what you need to do, some sort of community survey so you can get to some of these X and Zs so you can figure this all out?
