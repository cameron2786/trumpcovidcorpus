I do. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the invitation here today, and I appreciate what your team has done for us-

… as we have been working our way through this pandemic and the recovery. I think one of the most significant things that has happened was when we put out a cry for help with our meat packing plants, you sent in a CDC SWAT team that came into Southwest Kansas where we have multiple meat packing plants and really helped us set up the kind of system that we needed to have in place to ensure that those plants could stay in production. And I’m very proud to say that Kansas is one of the few, if not the only state, that did not have to actually shut down our packing plants.

We were able to create an environment that was safe. And we’re also able to provide, with your assistance, our own agency’s non-congregate living. Because, a lot of the folks who work in these meat packing plants live with a lot of other people. And so we were able to work with our community colleges and our hotels in that area to provide a quarantine space for folks. And that’s worked out really well.

I want to give a little shout out to the Senator Pat Roberts.

Who I think was instrumental in elevating our cry for help.
