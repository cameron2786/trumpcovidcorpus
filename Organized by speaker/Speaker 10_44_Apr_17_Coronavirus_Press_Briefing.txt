Thanks, Mr. President. I’m curious about some more of the dynamics we might see as the country begins reopening, as you put it, like a puzzle. So, as you’ve mentioned, we have states where we’re already seeing their curves begin to flatten, but then there are others like Florida or more rural parts of the country where they aren’t projected to peak for weeks or even months. So, can you talk a little bit about some of the difficulties that those later peaking states might face if they need to stay locked down for longer, even as other places around them are starting to open back up?
