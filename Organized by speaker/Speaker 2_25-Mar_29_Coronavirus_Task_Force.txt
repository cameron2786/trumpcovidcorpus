Thank you mister president. And thanks for your leadership on this. Because of that leadership. We have really seen the government agencies working with industry like no time before. We’ve seen HHS, FEMA, the CDC work incredibly effectively with all of the distributors, and all of the distributors working together for the good of the people. And all of us have been so focused on making sure that we take care of customers, because our customers are the ones that are taking care of the patients every day and we need to do everything we can to make things good for them. And so it’s been great to see how well all these government agencies have been coordinating together with us.
