Thank you, Mr. Vice President. In the next few weeks, the Supreme Court is said to rule on DACA on about the deferred action for childhood arrival. And about 30,000 of those people who are under that program are frontline healthcare workers. Is the administration in any way ready to protect them if the ruling comes in your favor and takes the protection out, and they can no longer work in the health field as they’re needed right now?
