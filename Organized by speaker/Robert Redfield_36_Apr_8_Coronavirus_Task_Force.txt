Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to add to what Ambassador Birx said. I mean, this is a consequence of the commitment of the American people. And a lot of us have always had challenges changing behavior, whether if it’s exercising regularly or different habits with smoking and when it affects us. What’s been remarkable to watch here, is how the American public has changed their behavior when it protects the vulnerable. I think that’s really what I’m so proud to see.
