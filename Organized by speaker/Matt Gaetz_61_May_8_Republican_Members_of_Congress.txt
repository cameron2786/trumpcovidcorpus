Thank you, Mr. President. Your team is here, we’re ready to work and we are inspired by our president. I have observed your willingness to work with anyone. I saw the Democrat Governor of New Jersey categorize the administration’s response as extremely responsive. I’ve noted on our calls that our Democrat colleagues in the house like Tom Suozzi and Jimmy Panetta have made contributions reflected in the great work that Jared has done on testing and that Secretary Mnuchin has done and that the chief has done as well. But I have to say, Mr. President, I’m deeply concerned about what we’re seeing from the Democratic leadership. Because in the last several days they have been caught in a terrible lie. Not only was there no collusion, we now know that the leaders of the Democratic Party knew that there was no collusion at the beginning and willingly lied to the American people anyway. Now we see that they’re reverting to their old playbook, as we want to work together to provide provision to our people and take good ideas no matter where they come from.

Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer just want to set up new committees to investigate rather than working together. I know that even before being president, you talked about the importance of the president being a great cheerleader for our country and for our economy. I know and I know in the jobs report today we can see that even the people who have been furloughed or who are on unemployment now, they’re optimistic that this is the team that will bring America back. What advice would you give us to try to have our Democrat leadership behave more like the governors you’ve worked with and some of the rank and file colleagues who’ve made helpful suggestions rather than just reverting to their hatred and their lies to cover their tracks for their last set of lies?
