<crosstalk 01:06:25> I have two questions. The first is to Secretary Pompeo, the News Hours has learned that the CDC picked up, that there was some sort of virus happening in Wuhan, the Coronavirus happening in Wuhan as early as December. When did the CDC start letting other agencies know that there was something in China happening, that this Coronavirus was happening and then when did the whole government approach start to happen?
Sec. Pompeo: <01:06:52>
So I’ll let the CDC or Dr. Fauci, you want to talk <crosstalk 01:06:57> please.
<01:07:13>
Mr. President, the other question I have for you, when-
<01:08:37>
Mr. Secretary, what message do you think it sends to other countries when you have the President of the United States lashing out at reporters?
Sec. Pompeo: <01:08:45>
I’ve had my frustration with reporters too. All I ask when I talk to the media is that you listen to what we say and report it accurately and it’s frustrating. It’s frustrating when you see that that doesn’t happen. It’s enormously frustrating. We have a responsibility to tell the American people the truth and those who are reporting on what it is we’re doing and saying have an equal responsibility to report accurately.
<01:09:06>
What message does it send to countries when you’re lashing out at reporters? <crosstalk 01:09:12>
Sec. Pompeo: <01:09:12>
I’ve seen many things at the state department be reported wildly inaccurately on multiple occasions, and I have spoken to those reporters about it each and every time, and I will continue to do so.
