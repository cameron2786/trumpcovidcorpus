Secretary, question on Iran again, is there any considerations to relax some sanctions in Iran during the Coronavirus crisis <inaudible 01:05:01> hard hit.
Sec. Pompeo: <01:05:01>
That’s an important question. The the whole world should know that humanitarian assistance into Iran is wide open. It’s not sanctioned. We offered to provide assistance to the Iranians as well. I talked with Dr. Tedros from the world health organization about this. We’re doing everything we can to facilitate both the humanitarian assistance moving in and to make sure the financial transactions connected to that can take place as well. There is no sanction on medicine’s going to Iran. There’s no sanctions on humanitarian assistance going into that country. They’ve got a terrible problem there and we want that humanitarian medical healthcare assistance to get to the people of Iran.

But the sanctions themselves, no number?
Sec. Pompeo: <01:05:38>
We are working to do all the things we’ve had in place for the first three years here to deliver security for the American people.
