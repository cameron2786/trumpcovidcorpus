Ambassador O’Brien, did a China under report, both the number of cases and the death toll from the coronavirus. And if that’s the case, Mr. President, what does that mean for our relationship with China and your relationship with President Xi?
Robert O’Brien: <20:09>
Well number one, I think the President has a great relationship with President Xi, and we’d like to have a great relationship with China. Unfortunately, we’re just not in a position to confirm any of the numbers that are coming out of China. There is no way to confirm any of those numbers. There’s lots of public reporting on whether the numbers are too low. You’ve got access to those reports that are coming out of the Chinese social media and some of the few reporters that are left in China. We just have no way to confirm any of those numbers. Thank you.
