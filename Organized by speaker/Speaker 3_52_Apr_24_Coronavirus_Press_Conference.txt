<Crosstalk 00:11:51> It’s a quick question and it’s timely because just about an hour ago as subcommittee with oversight released some findings that the FDA doesn’t have any review of the antibody tests that are on the market. There are no guidelines to tell which one should be out there and there’s no way to test their accuracy. They’re quite worried that these are junk tests on the market because they weren’t reviewed before they were approved. Is that true?
