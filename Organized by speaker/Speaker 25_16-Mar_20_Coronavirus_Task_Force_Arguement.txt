Secretary Pompeo, how exactly are you going to get those Americans back and do you have any plans to get the military involved in that?
Sec. Pompeo: <01:04:27>
We’re going to use all the tools we can. These first efforts are combined commercial private flights that will fly in, bring them back, bring them back to a destination here in the United States, so we’ll do that. There are some that will travel back other ways as well and we’ve worked with the department of defense to say where there are space available. We’ll be able to bring them back on those flights as well. That’s all government effort to make sure we get them back. They’re going to help us every place they can. Secretary <inaudible 01:04:51> talked about it a couple of times.
