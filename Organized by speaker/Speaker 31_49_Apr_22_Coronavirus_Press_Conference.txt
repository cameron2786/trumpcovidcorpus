I just a had follow-up question for Dr. Fauci, if you don’t mind.
<01:30:51>
But, I’m happy to ask you one after. So, John had asked the president about Rick Bright, and he said he wasn’t sure who that was, but I’m sure you’re familiar with who he is, since he was the head of BARDA. So, there’s concern or an accusation, he’s raised, that he was removed from his job because he protested widespread use of hydroxychloroquine. Are you familiar with this situation? And, do you feel like public health experts feel they are able to speak publicly or to speak out in opposition to certain things?
<01:31:24>
Yeah. So, you don’t feel like there’s any concern among people at the NIH right now or in the public health <crosstalk 01:31:29>?
