President, I-
<13:37>
I understand that the United States will certainly be more prepared in the fall, but how can you say that you know it won’t come back in the same level that it has today?
<14:19>
I understand the containment, but I don’t understand how you know it won’t come back on a big scale.
<14:54>
If you don’t think that it’s going to come back at the same severity as it is right now, why are you still directing that taxpayer dollars you spent on emergency procurement ventilators, tens of thousands of them?
<01:34:10>
Mr. President, also-
<01:34:20>
… also-
<01:35:06>
Mr. President, Senator-
<01:35:08>
…. McConnell said today that he would prefer to see states that have high public pensions declare bankruptcy rather than taking on more federal bailout money.
<01:35:23>
That’s what he said.
<01:35:27>
Would you agree with him on that? Or-
<01:36:07>
Are you concerned, sir, about the growing US national debt as a result of these stimulus packages?
