Mr. Vice President, last question about Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci. As you are both probably aware, there’s a lot of misinformation conspiracy theories out there about the coronavirus. There are some commentators who are suggesting that the number of dead are being inflated because they’re saying that people who are dying with other issues are being listed as COVID-19 deaths. Perhaps you’ve seen some of this commentary. You may be too busy to see it, but it is out there. What do you say to those folks who are making the claim without really any evidence that these deaths are being padded, that the number of COVID-19 deaths are being padded. For example, somebody might die from a number of factors, but had coronavirus are being listed as coronavirus deaths and because of that, the number is being inflated.
