Mr. President, one more question about reopening. The initial forecast showed that the real decline in the infection curve would be about June the 1st.

Latest forecasts have pushed that now back to August. I’m wondering what the ramifications might be for certain reopenings, particularly schools which begin to go back near the beginning of August.

We talked about this yesterday.

Do you think we’ll be in a place in August where schools at least in some states will be able to reopen?
