Mr. President, you’re now promising that everyone who needs a test will be able to get one at some point soon. Can you give us some figures on what you’re changing to ramp up testing? When will that be a true statement exactly? And how exactly are you going to accomplish that?

There does seem to be a double standard here, Mr. President, where members of your own staff can get tests frequently when they need it, but ordinary Americans can not.

So when will the rest of America have the same access that members of your own White House have to testing?
