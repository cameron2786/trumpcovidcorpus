At the <crosstalk 01:39:25> earlier where you said that you’re putting together the economic task force and that you thought that the recommendations were happening earlier than expected, did you mean to suggest that it could be before May 1st that you start recommending?
<01:39:43>
You’re not rolling out that it would be before?
<01:41:06>
On Abbott labs, you said-
<01:42:39>
So on Abbott Labs, you said testing is going great. We know that these machines had been sent to some of the governors, but some of them were saying they don’t have the materials to actually conduct the tests.
<01:42:54>
The federal government has distributed-
<01:43:14>
I do, the two different machines.
<01:43:23>
Okay, well, real quick. These 15-minute tests that you’ve sent out, these new ones that you had in the Rose Garden, they say, including Governor Sununu in New Hampshire, that they don’t have the cartridges to actually conduct the test, so when will they get those cartridges?
<01:43:40>
Are we looking at tripling?
<01:50:29>
Just wanted to clarify. In earlier conversation, there was a description of multiple different councils or task forces. Can you just explain exactly what the structure is of those <crosstalk 00:14:42>.
<01:51:15>
<inaudible 01:51:16>.
<01:52:06>
I’d ask how the task force is going to be structured. Is it one?
