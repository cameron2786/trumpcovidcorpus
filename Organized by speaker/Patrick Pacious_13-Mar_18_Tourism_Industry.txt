Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Vice President, Patrick Pacious, CEO of Choice Hotels International. We have 6,000 hotels in the US, that’s one out of every 10 hotels flies our flag. As others have talked about, we’re in secondary and tertiary markets. We may be the only hotel in a small town. Those owners have two kind of key concerns. One, what do they do with their employees when they’ve got zero occupancy, and two, how do they pay their mortgage? So it is this question of employee retention, and liquidity, so they can get through this period. 90% of our hotels are SBA-eligible, so we’re very familiar with the SBA loan program, and the disaster relief. There’s some red tape there that we have some suggestions that we think-

You want them right now?

I’ll give them to you right now. The first is the disaster relief cap. It’s only 2 million, and if you’ve taken out the full five, you can’t get access to the additional two. So we need the cap raised.
<12:01>
We need it at least raised to 10. 10 million on per individual basis.
<12:06>
Secondly is the personal liquidity test, which just got put in place. That could be rolled back. And the final one is figuring out the affiliation. So an individual may own a partnership in multiple hotel. So that again restricts the amount of capital available to them. So we’d really like the opportunity to speak to the SBA about lifting some of those requirements to really help inject more liquidity.

Absolutely.
