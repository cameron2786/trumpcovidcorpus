Well, I would just say, Mr. President, that again at your leadership, we’re funneling to 11 specific airports and contract medical staff that we put in place have screened over 53,000 individuals and prevented a number of folks from coming into the country. And that’s largely due to the cooperation and the flexibility of the individuals in this room. So again, thank you for everything that you’re doing to help us keep America safe.

Well, again, from a screening standpoint, we have some of the same measures that we do at airports of entry at our land ports of entry. So we CVP officers and again contract medical staff, some from HHS and some contract are again screening individuals and then referring to CDC as necessary. So some of the same procedures at airports taking place at land ports of entry as well as maritime ports of entry. So for DHS we’re looking at every way individuals come into the country, not just through the airports, making sure that we’re securing the country as a whole.

So what we’re asking for is additional pieces of information so that the CDC, HHS and others can track individuals as they come into the country and as they continue on to their final destination. And if we need to, from a health perspective, to continue to reach out, continue to track them and to get in touch with them, looking for a few more pieces of information and data from them.

I think we will continue to have conversations, but yes, we’ll get that for you.
