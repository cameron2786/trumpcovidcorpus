Thank you Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Adam, the team. I stand here before you in front of our 285,000 colleagues who provide care to patients every day across the country. One of the guiding principles we had when we went into this COVID-19 battle was to find partnerships, partnerships with other components of the industry, partnerships with other health systems, but partnerships with governments, both local and federal and we’re proud to be a part of this private-public sector partnership and I think it’s going to do great good for the community. So thank you very much.
