Yes. So John Seldon, who is running the general manager of Atlanta International-Hartsfield Airport, he is on our coronavirus taskforce here and he did a great job yesterday in our press conference, explaining the procedures that the President and others had put in place to make sure that everybody that’s coming from Northern Italy and South Korea are being screened multiple times before they get on the airplane. I think that just gives people great confidence as they’re traveling through all the airports across the country that the people that are coming in have been screened from those problem areas. The <inaudible 00:24:40> and border people are checking them as well and having conversations. I think they may have tested one person in the Atlanta Airport. They have over 300,000 people go through there a day. That test was negative and so it is safe to travel right now.

People just need to be very careful, do the things that the CDC and Dr. Redfield and Secretary Azar and the Vice President and his taskforce are telling people to do, and that’s keep your hands clean. Just be careful where you’re going. If you’re sick, don’t go to the airport. Don’t go to the sporting event.

No, no. Yeah. <crosstalk 00:26:03>

You’re all right.

And I would just say that we started testing in our lab in Georgia, our Department of Public Health, yesterday, which is a day earlier. We thought it would be today, so we are actually testing today.
