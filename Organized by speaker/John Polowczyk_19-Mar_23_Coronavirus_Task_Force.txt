Thank you, Mr. Vice President. So I’m Rear Admiral John Polowczyk. I’m the supply chain task force lead at FEMA. My task is to increase the supply of critical medical supplies, which include personal protective equipment and ventilators, items like that. I just want to take a few moments to explain the organization that we’ve stood up this week, these the last few days, and our approach.

We have a chart behind me. I have two focus leads, one on personal protective equipment, medical supplies; and a focus lead on ventilators.

Acceleration, we have a team of people that are searching globe for personal protective equipment. Figuring out where it is, figuring out if we need to buy it or just transport it and get it here faster.

We have a line of effort called reallocation. We’re working with our industry partners to illuminate the supply chain. There are many vendors, many distributors, all on separate system. Nobody has one sight picture for that supply chain. We’ve brought our industry partners in. We’re weaving that together to make better allocation decisions and understand where it is and where it needs to go.

We have a line called expansion. You’ve heard some of that today. If those that have wanted to convert plants, those that want to get into the business, we have the tools to help them to go do that.

Two focus areas right now, PPE and ventilators. Four lines of effort working the problem of the task to get more here and increase the supplies. Thank you, sir.
