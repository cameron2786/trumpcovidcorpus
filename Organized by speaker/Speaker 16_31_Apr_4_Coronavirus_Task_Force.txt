Mr. President, can we talk about Captain Crozier of the USS Roosevelt?
<54:23>
Captain Crozier that was removed as the commander of USS Roosevelt. I don’t know if you saw the videos of sailors cheering for him as he left. Our reporting shows that some sailors have said that they are worried to re-enlist because they are not convinced that commanders are taking care of their health and taking care of them.

What do you say to them? And how does removing this captain-?

Were you consulted about his removal?
