Thank you, Mr President. Question for Secretary Asper. The military personnel has been fanned out across the country to help combat the virus, is there any chance that they’re planning to see at some point having military personnel treat or see COVID-19 patients?

So as part of that, will they be seeing coronavirus patients or will they strictly be seeing other patients and helping them?

Building two new ones or deploying two new ones?
