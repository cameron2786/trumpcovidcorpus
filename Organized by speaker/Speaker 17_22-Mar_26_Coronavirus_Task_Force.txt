Quick question on the restrict… when you said no restrictions to states for something like that… if there was a high-risk county, and the restaurants are open in a low-risk county, wouldn’t your fear be that people in that high- risk county go over to the restaurants in that low-risk district?

What’s your timeline? What’s your timeline for implementing guidance like this?

Can I ask a quick follow-up, Mr. Vice President?
