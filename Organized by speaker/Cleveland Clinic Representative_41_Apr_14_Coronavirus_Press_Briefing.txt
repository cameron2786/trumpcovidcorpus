Thank you Mr. President for the invitation here. On behalf of the Cleveland Clinic, I would just like to offer a slightly different story about a Covid pandemic. In our home state of Ohio, we did an early institution of a social distancing. Our ability to scale up the testing and ramping out the capacity, we have actually seen a stable number of patients over the last 8 to 10 days. Only 160 patients have been hospitalized with Covid infection in Cleveland Clinic Health System. We are also very grateful for the support from our state government as well from our federal government. This is a battle where we’re all in together. We coordinate our efforts, share our resources and work together as one. I’m firmly convinced that we can do a lot of good when we work together. Thank you very much for having us. Thank you, sir.
