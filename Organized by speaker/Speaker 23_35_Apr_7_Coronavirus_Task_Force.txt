Mr. Vice President, thank you. One for you and then one for either of the doctors if you don’t mind. For you, sir, back to this idea of reopening up the economy. It’s not like there’s a switch that you can just turn it back on. How does the administration envision this happening? Is it guidance from the White House and you hope that governors follow it or are you going to put it in the governor’s hands or the mayor’s hands? How do you envision all of that working together?

Either for Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci. Do either of you want to take that? Secondly, as a lot of parents are sitting home with their kids and they’ve been home with their kids for weeks now and they’re wondering, maybe resigned to the fact that maybe their kids aren’t going back to school this year but are looking ahead. What do you think summer camp holds and what do you think the startup next school year holds if you could look down the line? Do you think those start on time? Do you think school next year starts on time?
