Mr. President, I thank you. What about the supply chains and then talking about preparedness for the future? Yesterday Larry Kudlow said that there was an idea of floating around the administration to cut taxes for companies who would be bringing their supply chains back to United States. He said he specifically liked immediate 100% write-offs for structures, equipment. But he said you hadn’t endorsed that yet. Would you endorse an idea like that?
