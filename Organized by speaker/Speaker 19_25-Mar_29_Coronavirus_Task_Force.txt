Mr. President, you mentioned that the peak could come in two weeks, can you ensure that everyone that needs a ventilator, every single patient that needs one will get one, will it get there in time? And my second question is, after invoking the Defense Production Act yesterday with GM, you said that there were a couple of problem children that may require using your authority again, what are those companies and what aren’t they meeting?
