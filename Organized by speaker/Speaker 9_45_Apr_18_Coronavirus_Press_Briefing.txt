Thank you, Mr. President. You’ve mentioned the importance of social distancing, but for example, Stephen Morrison, when you appointed to your open the country task force, is organizing a protest in Wisconsin, but aren’t they in a sense protesting your very own guidelines?

He said, sorry. He said, “We need to be the Rosa Parks of government injustices.”

Do you feel some of these protesters are protesting your social distancing guidelines?
