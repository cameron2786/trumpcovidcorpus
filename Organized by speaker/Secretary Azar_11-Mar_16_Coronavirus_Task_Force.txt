I prefer one of our medical professionals discuss that. That’s a clinical recommendation.

So in the previous 24 hours we saw a great deal of enhanced activity with relation to the HHS computer systems and website. Fortunately we have extremely strong barriers. We had no penetration into our networks. We had no degradation of the functioning of our networks. We had no limitation of our capacity for people to tele-work. We’ve taken very strong defensive actions. The source of this enhanced activity remains under investigation so I wouldn’t want to speculate on the source of it. But there was no data breach or no degradation in terms of our ability to function and serve our important mission here. Thank you.
