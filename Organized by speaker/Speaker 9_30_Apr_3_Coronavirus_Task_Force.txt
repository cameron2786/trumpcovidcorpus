So I wanted to ask you about the DPA. So you said that there will be a ban on exporting of all, what does it cover? So masks, gloves, what else?

The problem some people have raised is that if the US stopped exporting, what you could have is other countries then deciding reciprocally that they are going to stop exporting and that the result of that then will be a net decrease in the amount of supplies that American doctors, American hospitals have. How do you address that?
