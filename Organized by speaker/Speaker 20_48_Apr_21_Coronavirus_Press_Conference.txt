Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. One from me and one from a reporter who couldn’t be in the room because of social distancing. <crosstalk 00:50:31> So, my first question is about your immigration order. You campaigned on reducing legal immigration. I remember your speech in Phoenix in 2016 on reducing legal immigration.

You also campaigned on reducing legal immigration, and I’m wondering if some critics are saying that you are using the virus now in this crisis to follow through on that promise to reduce legal immigration.

As you know, a lot of farmers rely on seasonal migrant workers <crosstalk 00:52:19>.

Now, for a question from our reporter who is out of the room is from the Washington Times, Tom Howell. Why hasn’t the CDC, the federal government’s main disease fighting agency, had a more public facing role amid the pandemic if it was holding regular media calls early on but has not held one since early to mid-March?
