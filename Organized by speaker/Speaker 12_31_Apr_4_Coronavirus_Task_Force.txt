Mr. President, this is off topic. It’s about the announcement from last night. It’s a yes or no question, not that we expect the answer to be yes or no. But wasn’t Michael Atkinson doing the job of the inspector general of the intelligence community, the job he was supposed to do, when he simply took the whistleblower complaint to Congress, what hadn’t been taken previously? Wasn’t he doing the job that he was supposed to do, that American taxpayers were paying him to do? And why did you decide to terminate him?
