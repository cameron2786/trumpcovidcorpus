Can I ask you about the comments that a couple of your four aides have said today? Gary Cohn said, “Is it time to start discussing the need for a date when the economy can turn back on?” Where Steve Bannon is saying, “Drop the hammer today on the virus, we’re going to have to take the pain out front. We have to shut it all down.” I want to ask what the tension between, the economic pain we’re suffering, and of course the virus itself and the casualty and deaths from there?

Is that point coming sooner or-

When do you start opening main street back up?
