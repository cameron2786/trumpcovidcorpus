Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, your trade advisor Peter Navarro had been recommending an executive order that would ensure that the raw materials for pharmaceuticals and medical devices are manufactured here in the United States. We were getting some indications last week that you were close to signing this executive order. Can you tell us where you are on that?

Mr. President, I want to bring up what you referred to just a short while ago about politics. In your address to the nation, you said we have to put politics aside, stop the partisanship and unify together, but this morning you criticize the Democratic governor of Michigan. Yesterday, it was the Democratic governor of New York. You’ve attacked Obama. You attacked Biden. In fact, every day except one since that address you’ve lashed out a Democratic leader. Are you going to set the example?
