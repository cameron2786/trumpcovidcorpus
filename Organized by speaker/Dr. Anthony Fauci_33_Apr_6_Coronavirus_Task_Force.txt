I had good conversations with the governor of Nebraska and the governor of Iowa here. And it’s, interesting that functionally, even though they have not given a strict stay at home, what they are doing is really functionally equivalent to that. And we had a really good conversation with both of the governors. And when I had mentioned that I think there was a public response that they weren’t really doing anything at all and they really are doing a very good job, both of them. Those are the only two that I spoke to. But it was really good conversation and I want to make sure people understand that just because they don’t have a very strict stay at home order, they have in place a lot of things that are totally compatible with what everyone else is doing.

Yeah, well, Jon if back to normal means acting like there never was a coronavirus problem, I don’t think that’s going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population. But when we say getting back to normal, we mean something very different from what we’re going through right now. Because right now we are in a very intense mitigation. When we get back to normal, we will go back gradually to the point where we can function as a society. But you’re absolutely right. If you want to get to pre-coronavirus, that might not ever happen in the sense of the fact that the threat is there, but I believe with the therapies that will be coming online and with the fact that I feel confident that over a period of time we will get a good vaccine that we will never have to get back to where we are right now. So if that means getting back to normal, then we’ll get back to normal.
