Thank you, Mr. President. I had a question for you regarding one of the members of your Coronavirus Taskforce. And that’s Secretary of HHS, Alex Azar. On January the 28th he was in the briefing room, and in the briefing room he told reporters that for the individual American the virus should not be an impact on their day to day life. Three months later, more than 55,000 of our fellow Americans have now lost their lives. Mr. President, why is he still your top health advisor? Why is he still serving as the HHS Secretary?

…since April third Mr. President.

He has not been in a briefing, Mr. President, since April the third. Does that show confidence in him?
