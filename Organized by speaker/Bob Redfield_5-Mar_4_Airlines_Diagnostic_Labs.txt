Thank you, Mr. Vice President. So in the past we used to be able to have laboratories that could develop what we call laboratory developed tests and then be able to apply them for clinical purposes. And in the previous administration that became regulated so that now for someone to do that, they had to formally file with the FDA. And what the president’s decision did was allow that regulatory relief now and that those university labs and those other labs in this country now can be fully engaged in developing laboratory diagnostics for the clinical arena so the men and women this nation can get access to and the doctors to get to know the extent of HIV and the patients that they’re caring for. It’s really very, very important. It’s what’s changed the availability of testing overnight.

That public health evaluation is ongoing right now and we’re working with the airlines and obviously within their North Carolina health department. CDC supports the local public health department to really work together to get all that information that’s in progress.

My understanding is we have the manifest. Now the trick is to go find them and that’s why we’re having this discussion.
