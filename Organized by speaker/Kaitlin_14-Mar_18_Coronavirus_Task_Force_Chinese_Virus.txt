I have a question for you and then I have one for Secretary Wilkie as well.

But I’ll start with you. You just said there are a tremendous number of ventilators that we have, but for weeks hospitals have been warning about a critical shortage that they say we are not prepared for. So why did it take so long to invoke the Defense Production Act?
<47:40>
But we knew for weeks we needed more ventilators, so why did it take so long?
<48:04>
Yeah, you said you’d get back to us with those numbers.
<48:08>
The exact number?
<49:14>
But, we don’t have an exact number for nationwide. How many ventilators do we have?
