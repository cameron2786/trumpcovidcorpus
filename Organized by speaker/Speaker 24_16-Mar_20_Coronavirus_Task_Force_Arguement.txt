Secretary Esper is not here, but to get the test to the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Are you able to give us a progress report on the status of that if they’re all able to get tests?
Sec. Pompeo: <01:04:09>
I don’t know the answer to that. I know we have state department officials too who are concerned and want to make sure we get them tests, our team as well and we’re working on that. We’ve had a significant success on that to date. There are a few places we’ve not been able to get them, but we will. We’ll get them there.
