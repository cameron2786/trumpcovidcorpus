Thank you, Mr. President. What I want to say is I appreciate the information that your companies have given us today. Investors want to understand the operational and financial challenges you’re facing. The more they understand them, whether they’re good or bad, the more they’ll plan <inaudible 00:19:07> for overcoming them, the more confidence they have. Our markets work better. I’d be remiss if I didn’t thank Secretary Mnuchin and our friends at the FED for the way they supported our markets through this uncertain time. And I really want to thank the many companies who’ve been very candid with their disclosure about where they stand. That’s what our investors expect. I think you’ve done a terrific job giving our investors what they expect. I look forward to continuing to work with you.
