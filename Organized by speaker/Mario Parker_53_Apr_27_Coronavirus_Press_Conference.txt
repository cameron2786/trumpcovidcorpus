Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday you retweeted someone who alleged that Democrats have, quote, “inflated,” the mortality rate of the coronavirus by under-reporting the infection rate. Do you believe that’s true? That there’s some sort of conspiracy theory regarding the number of infections States are reporting?
