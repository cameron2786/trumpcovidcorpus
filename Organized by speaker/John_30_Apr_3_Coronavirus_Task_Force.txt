This is why the question of the stockpile that was asked earlier is so important.
<01:03:01>
It was a very important question because what Jared Kushner said yesterday is that the federal stockpile is for use by the federal government, not for the states to have access to. So you seem to be saying different, so did Jared Kushner misspeak yesterday?
<01:03:13>
Is that federal stockpile available to the states?
<01:03:20>
Not for the states to use?
<01:03:44>
So you will be using them for the states?
