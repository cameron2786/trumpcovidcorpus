If I can ask you about the tests, sir, for a second. If federal officials have shipped millions of tests as you and your colleagues have said, why is the federal government says only 59,000 tests been processed to this point. We just heard from the Atlanta public health director saying that they have fewer than 50 test kits for more than 900,000 citizens. Where are the tests?

Mr. President, perhaps I can follow up. How are non-symptomatic professional athletes getting tests while others are waiting in line and can’t get them? Do the well connected go to the front of the line?
<56:31>
Would you encourage them to defer a test to other?
<01:05:39>
And what do you say to them if they’re watching?
<01:05:43>
I think there are a lot of them watching. A lot of these people at home, these young people.
<01:05:46>
I was going to say what do you say to them?
