Mr. President, Andy Biggs, Arizona. Thanks for letting me be here with you today. Thanks for coming to Arizona this week. Being in Phoenix at Honeywell factory, converted doing 10 million N95 mask on a regular basis, and there’s going to be 10 more out of their Rhode Island plant.

Thanks for being there. We had Sammie’s Restaurant from Tucson up, but we also had several Latina business owners there that are strong supporters. And why are they supporters? Because of the economy that you built and you put in place. And Arizona is ready to open up. They’re energetic, they want to open up. They have faith and confidence in you and your leadership. Because they know what happened before. You built a marvelous economy, lower taxes, reduced regulations that really did a great number for our economy and that’s fantastic.

And I’ll tell you, we are just as frustrated that speaker Pelosi won’t bring us back to do work that we need to be doing. We need to set the example for the American people that we’re ready to be here. If you can go to a Starbucks coffee, as Kevin said yesterday, you should be able to come to Congress. So just so you know, the House Freedom caucus, we had a meeting last night. We’ll be meeting every day next week here in Washington DC. We want speaker Pelosi to know, we’re ready to work. We come to work. We represent the people. Thanks for your leadership, Mr President. It’s an honor to be with you.
