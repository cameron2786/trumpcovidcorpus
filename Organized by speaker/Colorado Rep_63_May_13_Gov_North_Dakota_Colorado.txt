Mr. President, so I think the key that Jared is talking about, the governor talks about is you have counties that have a plan they’re able to open up earlier than others because of the work that they’re doing. When the governor is talking about Grand Junction, you have restaurants that aren’t just open, but you have dine in. In some of these restaurants, which I think is maybe some of the first around the country to actually reopen to dine in because of the good work that they have done together.

Yesterday we talked as well about Colorado’s additional Thermal Fisher tests, and that’ll be a very big help to get those.

Well, hi. Thank you Mr. President. I want to thank the federal government for its partnership on our COVID-19 response. Particularly, the supplies you’ve given us, the tests. Look forward to that continuing and the more people we can test, and then we can force multiply that with contact tracing. So we can quarantine people that haven’t even had a test yet. That’s really the way that we’re going to contain the virus in Colorado. We’ve got a local public health department that covers every county. They are ready to do testing and contact tracing. So that’s our plan. It’s going to be a statewide effort.
