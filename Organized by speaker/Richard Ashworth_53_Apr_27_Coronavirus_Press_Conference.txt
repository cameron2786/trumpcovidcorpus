Thank you mr president. Appreciate the invitation to be here today and it was just 45 days ago when we were here. I’m Richard Ashworth, I oversee Walgreens in the US and I just want to start off Larry, like you thinking the over 200,000 Walgreen team members who are in stores every day all across America, taking care of our patients and our customers giving them essential daily needs, the prescriptions obviously that they need and even COVID testing while we’re here. We also announced today we’ll be expanding our testing capabilities across all States including Puerto Rico. We’ll be able to triple the volume that we do now in partnership with our lab partners and we’re excited to be able to do that. We’re really excited with the public private partnership that we have here because that’s what enabling us to do this and we look forward to working with the additional States to get these sites up and running as fast as possible.

As a pharmacist, I just want to say one quick thing. I’m really proud to be part of this profession and not just Walgreens pharmacists and pharmacy employees, but all of them across grocery, mass independence. You’re really doing what you should be doing and what you went to school for it to help patients, counseling them on their medicines and helping them understand the problems that we’re facing. Pharmacy is right here in it with everyone together in the community and we look forward to being part of the testing like we are now serology, whatever that might look like in the future and eventually treatment when the vaccine does come. So thank you Mr president for the opportunity. Thank you.
