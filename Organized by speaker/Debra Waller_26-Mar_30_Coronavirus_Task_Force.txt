Thank you Mr. President and Mr. Vice President on your guidance during this unprecedented time and I’m very honored to be here today. Founded by a minister 144 years ago, Jockey International is a family owned company headquartered in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

Since 1876, we have been providing socks and underwear for generations of families. It is part of our DNA to roll up our sleeves and help our country in her time of need. During World War II, we made parachutes for the military and today we are eager to serve this great country by providing support for the healthcare workers on the front lines of this fight.

As the president and vice president have said, it’s a whole of America approach and we are committed. Jockey has had a long standing partnership with Encompass Group, headquartered in Georgia, serving the healthcare community. When we learned of the critical need for PPE, we knew we had to help. That meant restarting production on tier three isolation gowns.

Monumental lifting by Jockey, Encompass, FEMA and the FDA was done in just a few days to be production ready. As a result, we expect to begin delivering 30 to 50,000 gowns per week, helping those that need it the most right now.

In addition, this week we are also donating 10,000 units of scrubs to the frontline doctors and nurses at the Javits Convention Center in New York City. We would not have been able to do this without the collaboration of the administration, representatives from the federal agencies and Congressman Brian Stiles.

Thank you very much Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.
