Thank you, Mr President. Ellie Maalouf of Intercontinental Sales Group, chief executive of the Americas. Thank you Mr. Vice President. We have nearly 6,000 hotels around the world, over 3,800 hotels in the United States, over 530,000 rooms. 80% of those are owned by small business people across 50 states, across every county, across every community. So we’re experiencing the same impact, similar to what the industry, the HLA and our colleagues here and talking about. I want to turn our attention to those small business owners in 50 states across the communities, because they are the bedrock of those communities, and as they’re getting impacted, it’s not just our employees that begin to see an impact in job losses, but it’s an entire ecosystem of their suppliers, their vendors. And so I think I’m very pleased that we can work together with you and the administration to find a solution to preserve that network of entrepreneurs across the country.
