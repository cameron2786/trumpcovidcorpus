Mr. President, forgive me if I heard you wrong at the beginning, but you said something, we are going to be going over to the Hill. Are you going yourself?

And on that matter. You’re asking Congress to essentially pass a series of legislation that’s going to amount to about $2 trillion, 10% of the GDP. What do you say to members in both parties who say, this is too expensive, this is just too much to debate and get done in 48 hours or so. And also have you spoken directly with Speaker Pelosi at all about any of this?
<01:20:15>
All right, guys, last question.
<01:20:21>
You guys have announced that standardized testing is essentially canceled in this country.

To the tens of millions of students out there, their teachers, and their parents who are sort of scratching their head wondering what does that mean, obviously, a lot of this is driven by local school districts, by the state, is there any federal guidance on this, and if not today could you have Secretary DeVos or somebody come and explain that to the millions who are literally sitting at home trying to figure out what exactly that means?

I mentioned I had a medication question, and I wanted to ask it while the president was here, because earlier he Tweeted that there were two certain medications that when taken together quote “Have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine” and that they should be quote “Put in use immediately.” Since he’s not here I can’t ask him what he meant, but I’m wondering if Dr. Fauci or the admiral could clarify if you have any sense of what he was talking about, and whether his 74 and a half million Twitter followers should be taking medical advice from him or from someone else.
