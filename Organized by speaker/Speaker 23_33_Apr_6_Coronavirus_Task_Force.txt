Mr. President, on the question of antibody testing which is FDA approved now but not widely available yet. I know the Admiral said by May you expect to have millions available. How are we going to prioritize who’s going to get the antibody tests, and what is that going to show you? Do you think that’s going to be immunity?
<01:27:39>
And by when, by May you are saying this will happen?
<01:28:20>
And how will you prioritize Who gets those tests? I mean, tens of million, we’re a country of 300 million, how do you determine who you’re going to have have that test?
