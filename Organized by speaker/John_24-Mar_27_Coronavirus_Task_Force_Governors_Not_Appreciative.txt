Two questions for you. One on state quarantines and the other one on this search for treatment. The first one over the last 24 hours, governors in multiple States, including Florida, Rhode Island, have issued quarantine orders for travelers coming from-
<21:02>
Quarantine orders, yeah. And they are intercepting people on highways, at airports. They say this is at the recommendation of your administration. Is that true? And if so, why doesn’t-
<21:43>
Mr. President, if I can come back to the invoking DPA, this morning you tweeted about it and I’m told it was coincidentally not long after that tweet, Vintech and GM announced that they had reached an agreement to at their Kokomo, Indiana plant, which is a clean facility that makes electronic equipment, produce up to 10,000 ventilators a month with the first ones to be delivered in a couple of weeks. Why the need after that to invoke DPA?
<22:41>
Last night you told Sean Hannity you didn’t think that there was a need for 30 or 40,000 ventilators, yet today you basically federalized General Motors to produce tens of thousands.
<23:26>
<inaudible 00:23:29>.
<34:40>
Mr. President, on Monday will be the end of the 15 days to slow the spread of the virus. Do you expect that you will simply renew the guidelines, or do you expect that there could be some modification to those guidelines?
<35:08>
Are there any early indications-
<35:41>
So for people at home who are wondering, how long are we going to have to live like this, what advice would you give them?
<36:10>
So could it be months?
<52:39>
Mr. President, on this question of the ventilators, I understand you have a question whether or not New York needs as much as they want. Governor Cuomo’s saying 21 days from now.
<53:52>
Here’s my question.
<54:59>
Is 100 days fast enough? You said, is that fast enough? To get 100,000? Because some of these people need them in three weeks.
<55:50>
The question I was building up to is, are you able to guarantee, to assure these states, these hospitals, that everybody who needs a ventilator, will get a ventilator?
<56:28>
Everybody who needs one will be able to get a ventilator?
<56:35>
It’s a fundamental question.
<58:01>
Could the Easter goal stick? It seems like earlier in the week you said we’d love Easter, but now it seems like it could be longer.
<58:07>
These people are heading into a long weekend. What do you tell those folks who think they’re going to have to wait this out for a while?
<01:00:55>
Can I ask you-
<01:01:16>
Just before you go, can I ask you something that just popped on Wall Street Journal? Says headline, The Trump Administration plans to suspend the collection of import tariffs for three months according to administration officials. True, or not true?
<01:02:37>
Thank you Mr. President.
