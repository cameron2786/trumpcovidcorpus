Dr. Fauci, and I’m going to read my notes so I’ll get this right, but there apparently a new study out of China. It found that the vast majority of cases, 86%, were untested patients with mild to no symptoms. What does that say about the impact of testing? Does it mean that testing should actually go beyond the sickest patients?
