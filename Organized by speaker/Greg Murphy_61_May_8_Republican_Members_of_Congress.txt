Thank you MR. President. Greg Murphy from Eastern North Carolina. I appreciate your strength. I appreciate your persistence. I’m a surgeon and I appreciate decisiveness. It’s been nothing but a merciless last four years that Schumer, Pelosi, and her cabal have essentially tried to undo the 2016 election. I’ve only been in politics a relatively short period of time, but it’s obvious to me that there are people in this country who hate you, and hate this administration, more than they love this country. And they will see it torn down.

This crisis has highlighted this. We thought that this possibly could be a way of bringing our nation together, but unfortunately partisan politics has <inaudible 00:56:41> the day. This has been building a plane while we’ve been flying it. I think that’s a very good analogy, but the plane is built and it’s time to land. It’s time that we made decisions based upon fact, not fiction, not fear-mongering, not cartoons by the media, but truth. And it wouldn’t it be nice to get the truth? We believe enough in our American people that we believe in what they can think. So I would ask the same for you from North Carolina that you do from Pennsylvania to talk to our governor, to let us come back to work. Let us look at a regional approach in North Carolina. It makes sense. We look at the science, we can do this. We’re not inventing the wheel again. So I thank you for your strength. I thank you for your persistence and your leadership.
