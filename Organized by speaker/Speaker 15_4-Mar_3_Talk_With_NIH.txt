Mr. Secretary, can I ask you about this study from the CDC today that showed the Americans most at risk of contracting coronavirus, are people living with patients. So should Americans be less worried about catching the virus from say people on the street or people on an airport?

Mr. President, I don’t know if you had seen reports about the Vice President having shaken hands with students from a Florida school, one of whom had been placed in a voluntary self quarantine. Does that concern you at all? What did you think about that?
