Chip Rogers, president and CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging Association. I’ll be quick. Industry-wide, last year, occupancy was 67%, that helped support 8.3 million jobs. Right now, as these gentlemen have indicated, we’re probably under 20% nationwide, and headed South. If by the end of the year we get up to 35%, and nothing else happens, that’ll be about 4 million jobs lost. That’s if we can get back up to 35%.

Yes, the quicker the better.
