Brad Tilden, Alaska Airlines. We appreciate the efforts, Mr. President. I think like all of the folks around the table, the focus of the airline leadership teams is the safety of our employees and the safety of our customers and that’s what we’re focused on. I think all of us have made a lot of changes to our cleaning procedures, changes to our onboard procedures, to gloves, sanitation, the service that our flight attendants are providing our customers and we’re trying to do everything we can to help everyone contain the virus and contain the spread of it. And we appreciate it. If there’s more that we can do to help, we’re here to tell you that we want to do that.

We’ve taken a good look at them. The stuff that we’re using, I think we’ve concluded is effective, but we are changing the routines. There’s three levels of cleaning that we do and we’re intensifying the cleaning of the aircraft.
