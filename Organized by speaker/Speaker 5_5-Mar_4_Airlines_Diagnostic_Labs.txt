Well, thank you Mr. President. And again, we appreciate the leadership, appreciate the collaboration and coordination and certainly the industry wants to do everything that we can to keep Americans safe and certainly our employees and our customers. We’ve stepped up our efforts to make sure the airplanes are cleaned and disinfected and we work very closely with the CDC and I think that’s gone very, very well. So we’ve got the proper protocols in place whenever there is a suspected illness. And I think all that’s working very well where I think everybody’s doing a great job and doing all we can.
