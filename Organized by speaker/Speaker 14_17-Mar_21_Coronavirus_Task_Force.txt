Mr. Vice President. The military has sent planes to Honduras, Morocco, and Peru to pick up Americans and bring them home who have been stranded there, but there’re still a lot of other Americans who are stranded and can’t get home, so does the military plan to send planes to pick those folks up? Where will those planes be going? When will they be going? And can you assure Americans that who are stranded in foreign countries that they will be able to get back?
