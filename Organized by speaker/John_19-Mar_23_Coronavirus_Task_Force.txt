Thank you, Mr. President. If I could, the Washington Post is reporting that total deaths today crossed 100 for the first time. This morning, your surgeon general on The Today Show said he wanted Americans to understand that this is going to get really bad. Do you share that prognosis?

Mr. President, I want to ask you about these guidelines on testing. Obviously, Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for coronavirus, but he was not in contact with anybody who was a known positive and he didn’t have any major symptoms. Under your guidelines, under the guidelines that have been outlined here, he would not have gotten a test. He got one anyway. What do you say to him? He’s pointed out that if he hadn’t gone basically in defiance of these guidelines and got tested, he might still be showing up to the Senate right now and infecting the whole US Senate.

But if we can just with the example of Rand Paul, and obviously there are many other people that would be in a similar situation, but just keep with this one example. If he hadn’t gotten that test, he would still be showing up to the Senate every day, to his place of work.

Hey, Mr. President, when you say you didn’t want the cure to be worse than the problem itself, are you saying that if we kept these measures that we’re doing now in place for a couple of months to a few months-
<46:42>
Weeks or months? Because you seem to be <crosstalk 00:18:45>.
<01:17:13>
So Mr. President, when you talk about how it could be a much, much bigger problem, you said that at several stages on whether or not we keep these guidelines in place. You talked about higher death, are you talking about suicide? Like help us understand <crosstalk 01:17:25>.
<01:17:27>
Is the risk here a depression? Is that what you’re getting at?
<01:17:41>
You mean economic depression?
<01:17:47>
You could be talking about economic depression.
<01:18:36>
If you get the bill passed.
<01:18:39>
And you’re confident?
<01:23:39>
Mr. President, so ultimately, will you take Dr. Fauci’s recommendation on this or are you thinking he’s just looking at one set of inputs?
<01:36:01>
Are you worried that if you do this too quickly, if you lift these restrictions too quickly, the virus will start spreading on unabated and how can you be sure that’s not going to happen?
