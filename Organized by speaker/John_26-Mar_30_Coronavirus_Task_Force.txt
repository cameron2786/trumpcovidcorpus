Thank you Mr President. Yesterday you said that you would be extending the guidelines through the end of April and that you’ll be giving us specifics tomorrow. Do you expect that the guidelines will just carry on the guidelines that have been in place now for 15 days? Could there potentially be some modification? Also, you have some travel restrictions that come up for reconsideration. The one from the EU on April 13th, Canada, US-Mexico border on April the 21st, well, what will happen with all of that?

And if I could ask you too, you talked about Ford now ramping up production of ventilators. The government is sending thousands of ventilators across the country. Clearly the supply is increasing, but when you look at the production curve against the hospitalization curve, can you guarantee that everyone who needs a ventilator in the next few weeks will be able to get one?

So do you believe as we approach this peak in a couple of weeks that there will be enough for the American populace?
