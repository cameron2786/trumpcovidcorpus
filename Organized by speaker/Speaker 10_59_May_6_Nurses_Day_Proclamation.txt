Sure there’s always a lag time between what happens in real time versus when you guys get it and run it. So the PPE, the ventilator situation, yes it got to a point where it was getting a bad but manufacturing ramped up and I think those are two things that we knew we would take care of as a country. The third thing that we can’t manufacture and I’ve talked about this before as a doctor or a nurse or essential personnel we can’t just manufacture them. So ultimately that ended up being the weakest point for us on the front lines. We had the PPE, we had the ventilators in time, but we just didn’t have enough people. We couldn’t get them there fast enough.
