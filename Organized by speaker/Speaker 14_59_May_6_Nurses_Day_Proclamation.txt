Mr president, I just wanted to add one thing too. I’m a nursing supervisor where I work at and one of the blessings I have is my director, my assistant director, his name is Dennis Hunter. He said, you know what? You guys take care of nursing, we’ll make sure we have the supply. When we all talk about the fears, it makes it so much worse for us nurses to work. We’re seeing the reality of it but to hear it on constantly, there’s not enough, there’s not enough. In reality I’m not seeing it, I’m in the hot zone right now. I’m in South New Jersey, we’re very close to New York and we are slowing down.
