So we are filling the governor’s request, and so we send that resource to them. They will put it to best use, they’ll put it to where they will have the most effect. So we don’t dictate exactly where it goes. Again, it’s a request from the state to the federal government for a certain asset, and those assets are sent the governor can use it as he or she sees fit.
