Thank you Mr. President, Mr. Vice President for bringing us together today. I’m proud to be able to represent the men and women of Proctor and Gamble who every day, 24 hours a day, are working to build and make essential cleaning products, hygiene products and healthcare products for families everywhere. These include healthcare workers and for institutions that are serving those in the front line. P and G people are the faces of the brands you know and trust. Brands like Tide, Pampers, Bounty, Charmin, Mr. Clean and Vicks.

In addition to making, packing and shipping these essential items, they’ve worked together to transform our plants to make things we’ve never made before like hand sanitizers and facial mask. Some of these are already getting to national, state and local agencies. Some of them are in the hospitals already. Everywhere around the world, P and G people are working every day to serve everybody, consumers and they’re working together to bring together the full capability of our research and development, our engineering, our manufacturing and our communications capability to make sure we make a difference to the consumers we serve and to all the audience that we can make a difference to.
