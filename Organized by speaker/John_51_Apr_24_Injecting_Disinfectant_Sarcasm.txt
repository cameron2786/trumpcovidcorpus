Mr. President, can I make a comment on the energy, sir? Sorry to interrupt.
<11:34>
But first I want to thank you and your administration. Your involvement on the OPEC deal was incredible, vital. It wouldn’t have happened without what you did. Your whole team has been very focused on energy. I do think one issue that a number of us are starting to have concerns about is there are big American financial institutions that the federal government has helped many times. They’re going to do well with regard to facilitating some of the Cares Act stuff. They’re starting to discriminate against American energy companies, discriminate against investment in my state, in Alaska, and I think it’s going to be really important.

These big Wall Street banks that want the federal government to help support them, and then they discriminate against a critical sector of the U.S. economy. By the way, the sector in the 2008, 2009 recession that really drove us out of our recession. I don’t think they should be allowed to do that, sir, and I know you have concerns about that.
<14:45>
Yes, sir. Great.
<14:52>
We love you in Alaska. I’ll tell you that.
