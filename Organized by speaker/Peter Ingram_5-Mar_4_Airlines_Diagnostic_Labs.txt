Peter Ingram with Hawaiian Airlines. Mr. President, I echo my counterparts in the industry talking about the safety of our guests and our employees is paramount in everything we do and really appreciate the collaboration with the administration and the government to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to ensure that. I think it is very helpful to hear Dr. Burks talk about the specific areas of risk because there is a lot of concern out there. There’s concern internationally about travel and there’s concern domestically and I think the more information that we have to share with our guests about the facts is very helpful as we go forward with this challenge.
