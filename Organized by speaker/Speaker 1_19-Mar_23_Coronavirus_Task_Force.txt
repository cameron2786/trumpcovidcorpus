Sir, I’m just trying to reconcile the two things that you just said. One that things are going to be very, very bad; and two, that you want to get the country opened back up as quickly as possible. I guess my question is if in a week Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauchi are telling you we need to continue these measures for the health of the vulnerable populations of the country, are you going to say, “I’m sorry, the economy is too important.”

And maybe Dr. Birx can speak to this. Do you share the President’s optimism that in a week we might have a situation where we can say there’s a few hotspots but much of the country’s <crosstalk 00:39:04>

Yeah, and are you worried that some cities and states that haven’t had the infection yet are lagging indicators and that we’re going to start seeing cases?
