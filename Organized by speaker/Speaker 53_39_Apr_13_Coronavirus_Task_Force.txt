Thank you so much. One for the Admiral and then one for Dr. Fauci if you don’t mind. For the Admiral, wouldn’t it have been useful as you’re going through all of those supplies that are now making their way into the system you talked about having to buy foreign products as we’re catching up and making it. Wouldn’t it have been useful if it hadn’t taken until mid March for the government to start placing bulk orders for these kinds of supplies?

My question is about the time in here <crosstalk 00:15:20>.

I wanted to ask Dr. Fauci, you said that you’d be giving the president your recommendations, you and Dr. Birx coming up with a plan that you guys are comfortable with. Once the president has made his decision, are you willing to come here and tell us, tell the American public what you actually had recommended to him and whether he followed through with what you recommended?

So when the president stands up here, whether it’s May 1st whatever day it is and outlines his plan, are you willing to stand up here after him and tell us all, tell the American public what it was that you had recommended he do if there is a difference?
<02:24:28>
So that we would know whether he was actually listening to the health advice that he’s being provided.
