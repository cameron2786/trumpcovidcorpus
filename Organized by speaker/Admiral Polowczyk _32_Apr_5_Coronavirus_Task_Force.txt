Yes sir. So, correct. FEMA is working on a plan to be able to move ventilators. So for example, DOD gave another 500 ventilators. They’re on the move, being staged at Fort Dix to be able to rapidly deploy them to locations. To include, you heard the president mentioned States giving to States. Things like that. So that there’s the ventilators that aren’t in use that conceivably we could rapidly move as well.

The large balance of them are on the shelf.
