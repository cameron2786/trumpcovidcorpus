Mr. President, a few questions if you don’t mind, sir. If you’ve lost your job now or you’re worried that you’re going to lose your job tomorrow, restaurant, something like that, what do you want people to do immediately? The second question, sir, you heard from the vice president that he’s going to be tested. Are you, have you taken a test since last Saturday?
<39:52>
You just took one. How are you feeling?
<40:06>
Okay, so for those people that have lost their job already or they’re worried that they’re about to lose it tomorrow or the next day, what do you want them to do right-
<01:12:19>
Thank you for the numbers on the testing by the way.
<01:12:21>
Are you going to share any other hard numbers on the number of available tests, on number of ventilators in the federal stockpile?
<01:12:35>
The 500 billion masks that you cited they’re due for delivery in 18 months.
<01:12:40>
500 million masks.
<01:12:40>
Excuse me, thank you.
<01:12:42>
Half a billion masks, they’re due for delivery according to HHS within 18 months. The last number of ventilators we had was 12 to 13000. Can you give us an updated number on that?
<01:13:42>
Do you have numbers to share right now? Do you have numbers to share with us right now on stockpile?
