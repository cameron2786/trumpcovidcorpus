A quick follow-up, one on the economy and the other on the broader picture here, but just to follow up on my colleague, some people did note that your tone seemed more somber yesterday. You talked about that August timeline. Did you see a projection? Some people thought perhaps that two million potentially that could die, maybe prompted part of that. Was there a shift in tone?

You said that the 15-day guidelines was the next natural step. Is the next natural step after that a national lockdown, similar to what San Francisco is doing?
