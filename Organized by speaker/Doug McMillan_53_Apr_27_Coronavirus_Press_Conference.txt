Thank you Mr president. My name is Doug McMillan. I’m a Walmart associate and I too would like to start by thanking our associates for everything that they’re doing in our store, Sam’s clubs, distribution centers, and in our eCommerce fulfillment centers. They’ve been inspiring and continue to have a can do attitude and step up. It’s much appreciated. We started 45 days ago as that everyone else and we’ve been operating sites for a while now. We’re now up to 20 sites across 11 States. By the end of next week we’ll be to 45 and by the end of may, we’ll be at 100 and we also, a few weeks ago, vice president Pence and I were in a distribution center in Virginia food distribution center. He was kind enough to come and thank our associates for us there, which is much appreciated.

And the president and vice president were speaking on the phone about surgical gowns and the president asked if we could put in an order for millions of surgical gowns and we don’t normally buy those. So I wasn’t sure if we were going to be able to do that. But I’d like to thank our apparel team and McKesson in particular for partnering with us. We’ve been able to in the month of April, secure an additional two and a half million surgical gowns and by the end of May we’ll have an additional 6,000,000 available to help. So thank you for the opportunity to serve and for being here.
