Thank you Mr. Vice President. Could you give us more details on the potential financial assistance for the entertainment industry, for the cruise industry, that the administration is looking at right now? And if I may on the temperature checks, were all of the members of the cabinet who were in here today, did they also have their temperatures checked? Okay, I see you nodding. But is it also the White House policy now that anyone who for instance comes into the oval office needs to have their temperature checked at the door?
