Mr. President, thank you so much. What is your message for some leaders in Latin America, like the president of Brazil who just on Sunday was taking photos with supporters encouraging mass demonstration? And just yesterday president from Brazil said that we should not be surprised if we see him in the next few days in a crowded subway and San Paolo or on a bus and Rio because he is the president and should be with the people. What do you think about that? What is your message?

How about encouraging mass demonstration at this moment?
