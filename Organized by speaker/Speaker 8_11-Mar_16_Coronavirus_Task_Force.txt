Two questions here, Mr. President. One going off of what he was asking. How many ventilators and how many ICU beds do we have right now and will it be enough?
<25:47>
And you’ll give us the exact number?
<25:51>
Because so far they have not given us an exact number.

Yesterday you said that this was, “Under tremendous control.” Do you want to revisit that statement if we are going to be experiencing this until July or August, five more months ahead of right where we are now?
<26:26>
You not saying, “It’s under control,” right?
<26:30>
Coronavirus.

Yesterday you had said it was.
