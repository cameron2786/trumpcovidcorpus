Thank you, sir. A question for me and then another question, if you’ll let me, for some of my colleagues who are social distancing.

The first question has to do with a cruise liners like Carnival and Royal Caribbean. They want this relief aid, but they’re worried because they offshored to places like Panama and Liberia, they might not qualify. Senator Holley has said that they should move back to the United States before they get a check. Do you agree? Should they pay U.S. taxes to get U.S. taxpayer relief?

The second one. Thank you, sir. The Senate bill includes aid that’s directly tied to the airlines and since before the pandemic, Boeing was already suffering from the losses of 737 MAX airplanes. Do you think it’s appropriate to use this legislation to provide them with $17 billion of aid on top of 25 billion that they could qualify for as a passenger airline, and then another four billion that they could qualify for as a cargo airline? Is that fair?
