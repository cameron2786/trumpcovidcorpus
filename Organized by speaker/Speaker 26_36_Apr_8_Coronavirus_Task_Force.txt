Thank you. Mr. Vice President. Kansas governor Laura Kelly says that she has put in seven requests to FEMA for supplies from the stockpile and those have not been fulfilled. So will Kansas be getting any of the ventilators because the request included ventilators and does she need to be calling the White House instead? Have you spoken with her directly?

You brought up social distancing and the work that Kansas has done. there’s actually a controversy right now over her order to limit the number of people in religious gatherings to 10 people. Should states be telling religious institutions how many people can gather if it’s to stop the spread of the coronavirus?
