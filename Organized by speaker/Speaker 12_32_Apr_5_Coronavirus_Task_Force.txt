Sir, I have one question on oil, but first I was hoping to ask Dr. Birx a question. The president just said that based on the most recent data that you’ve seen some change in the projection. I’m wondering if you could … You obviously have a week’s more worth of data since the sort of 100,000 to 240,000 potential death figures that you gave us last week. So I’m wondering with all the caveats that this is sort of based on, continuing social distancing and that we might see if one city pops, things could change dramatically. What, are the sort of range that you’re now looking at in terms of total death impact?
