I have a question for Dr. Monroe please. Would you admit that the CDC did have problems with the testing? You say that there were people who, that these health officials never had to request <inaudible 00:06:32> the test but you set such strict guidelines so people were coming in and saying they couldn’t get the test. And we talked to dozens of people that have contacted us saying they couldn’t get the test even though they had the symptoms because they didn’t meet your criteria because your tests were faulty.
<07:42>
But you didn’t have to start from scratch. You could have just used the WHO’s test. Why did you choose to start from scratch when <inaudible 00:07:42> the process?
<07:57>
Right, but there’s didn’t have any faults.
<08:00>
<crosstalk 00:08:00> so what do we <crosstalk 00:08:00>?
<08:01>
Please.
<08:39>
But they had to send it here because there were false readings.
<09:11>
And President Trump, are you confident in the CDC?
<09:15>
And do you have confidence in the CDC <crosstalk 00:09:17>?
<09:35>
<inaudible 00:09:36>-
<13:36>
Can I just ask one question about containment? You’re saying that you have <crosstalk 00:13:40> seen these clusters, but from last Friday to today we’ve gone from something like 57 or 59 cases, in seven days we have 200, and we even haven’t had the testing to see if there are more than that. So now we’re actually getting the testing, don’t you think it’s likely there are a lot more people out there who are going to come and actually be sick?
<17:25>
I’m from CNN.
<17:31>
Oh, okay. Well, nice to meet you.
<20:42>
And Mr. <crosstalk 00:20:43> you were shaking a lot of hands today, taking a lot of close pictures. Are you protecting yourself at all?
<20:47>
How are you staying away from germs?
<22:44>
Is there a risk if there’s that many people close together?
<25:34>
I’m not trying to be negative. I’m trying to help people understand when they can get the test, and I want to ask Secretary Azar because he said most of them ahead shipped out. Can you tell me exactly how many people as of right now can be tested? You told me yesterday, you thought it would be 475,000. How many kits have been shipped, and how many people do you think can we test <crosstalk 00:25:51>
<25:54>
Okay, great. Okay, thanks. Perfect.
<26:35>
Great.
<26:57>
Yeah <inaudible 00:26:58>
<29:19>
Can I clarify about the <crosstalk 00:29:21>
<29:26>
Could I clarify something?
<29:26>
About the cruise ship, has a decision been made?
<29:35>
And are u the final decider?
<30:57>
Is there going to be a way for us to advance our test in the way that South Korea has? They have the drive-through testing now <crosstalk 00:31:02>
<31:06>
10,000 people a day?
<31:06>
And are we going to be <crosstalk 00:31:06> capacity?
<31:27>
Yeah. <crosstalk 00:31:28> capabilities
<32:31>
And that testing platform is what you’re saying is available through Quest and so it will likely be available starting Monday we think when they’re up and running.
<34:52>
Last night you said you had anticipated this kind of thing happening. Do you think that having the office pandemic preparation in the White House that everyone on staff <inaudible 00:35:02>.
<36:06>
<inaudible 00:00:36:10>.
<36:59>
Mr. President on the numbers, where are we now with the forecast?
<37:57>
Just from a health perspective.
<39:13>
The vice president went to see the Seattle area yesterday.
<39:17>
And the Governor Inslee. He was very complimentary of Washington’s response. The governor was a little less complimentary of your response.
<40:28>
I have one quick question just for the people who are watching who are concerned and have symptoms. Is it possible or is it a good thing or something that we’re looking into to be able to test people in mass like they’re doing in other countries so that they can just show up and get tested?
<40:46>
Then their testing.
<43:41>
Is the strategy shifting from containment to risk mitigation?
