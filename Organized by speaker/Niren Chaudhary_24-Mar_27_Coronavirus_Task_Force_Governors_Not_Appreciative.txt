Good evening. Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for your leadership. It’s an honor to be here, and I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity. This is an extraordinary time, and I passionately believe that, at such times, we must all come together and do our very, very best to contribute and make a difference.

At Panera, our mission is simple. It is about ensuring that good food is accessible to everyone, especially those who are the most vulnerable, such as children, and especially at a time like this. We are absolutely determined to make a difference in this regard.

Today, we are announcing a partnership with USDA and Children’s Hunger Alliance to serve freshly prepared, wholesome meals to children in the entire state of Ohio to begin with, and hopefully, after that, we’ll expand that program across many of the states in the country.

I do believe that the human experience, indeed, life is all about having resilience in the face of adversity and also having the tenacity to just keep going, to just keep going. At Panera, our associates and our franchise partners live that spirit every single day. They’re resilient, and they’re tenacious. On their behalf, I pledge that we are committed to do the right thing for the country and help serve those who need it the most. At this very important time, we are ready to serve. Thank you very much.
