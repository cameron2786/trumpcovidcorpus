Mr. President may I ask you about credit and debt as well. Many American individuals and families have had to tap their credit cards during this period of time and businesses have had to draw down their credit lines. Are you concerned, Mr. President, that that may hobble US economy, all of that debt, number one? And number two, would you suggest to credit card companies to reduce their fees during this time?
