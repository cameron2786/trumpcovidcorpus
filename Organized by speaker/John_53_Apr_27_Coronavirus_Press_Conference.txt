Good morning. This sounds incredibly promising. Walgreens, CVS for the drive through test, the diagnostic agencies. But we sat here in the Rose Garden back on March 13 and these companies were here, some other companies were here. By my count, only 69 drive through test sites have been set up by the companies that were here. I’m wondering if… And of course Mr. Vice President back in early March, you said we’d be at four million tests by the following week. We’re just now got there in the last few days. So what have you learned about what went wrong a month and a half or over the last month and a half or two months? And what’s going to go right now? What lessons have you learned from the mistakes over the last month and a half or so?

So when you said four million tests seven weeks ago, you were just talking about tests being sent out, not actually being completed? I’m a little confused.

Follow up, Mr. Vice President. A follow up.
