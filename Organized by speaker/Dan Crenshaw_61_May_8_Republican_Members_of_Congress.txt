Oh, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for having us here and thank you for working every single day. Speaker Pelosi would have America believe that we can only show up to Congress to vote every once every three weeks. Of course that’s not true. We could be working every single day just like this administration is. And I appreciate what you’ve done. Appreciate working with us to protect our energy industry. America is in real dire straits, with oil prices the way they are, we’re deeply worried about that in Texas and your administration has been excellent to work with on that front. We understand how important energy independence is to our nation. Texas is reopening and I think it can be a model for the rest of the country as we step out of a retreat and move to actually confront this virus head on and get people back to work.
