Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Secretary Perdue, and Secretary DeVoss. Right now, there’s a lot of focus on our large cities and the enormous challenges that they face, but imagine this. You live in Iberia Parish, Louisiana, or you live in the Nome Borough in Alaska. Your schools are closed, and normally, your children get two meals a day at school. Both parents are working from home, but Mom and Dad just can’t get to town, where meals are being offered for pickup.

That’s about to change and change for the better. Because of this USDA program, McLane Global will source, secure, receive, organize, assemble, package, label, and then deliver boxes straight to a child’s home. Here’s another big difference. For the first time, we’ll be able to offer shelf-stable meals that will last two weeks. That’s a true game-changer for rural families. It’s happening because of the President’s order to do whatever it takes to get the job done. Everyone knows that tons of paperwork can be like lighter fluid for a great idea, and this is a great idea. We field tested it in 2019, and it worked.

You’ve heard today about the administration’s work on this project. Here’s some other important partners in this effort. We have Baylor University. They will provide sponsorship and oversight. In addition, we are deeply appreciative to UPS and the United States Postal Service, and we are joined by PepsiCo company to help get this accomplished.

Because of this collaboration and our tireless employees, I can report to you the boxes are ready to ship. After all, this is all about the children who must be fed during this crisis. We stand ready to serve. Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for caring about the specific needs for the children who live in rural America. Thank you.
