I just want to make it clear that in terms of tests, we have provided all the tests in the state of Washington and the state of California that they’ve asked for. The production and shipping of tests that we’ve talked about all week is completely on schedule. All of the CDC tests, the tests that are available to test up to 75,000 people, CDC has shipped to America’s public health labs. Those are out. Then IDT, the private contract working with CDC to ship to the private sector and hospitals, has already shipped enough tests for 700,000 tests, and the remaining lots are arriving at CDC this morning for quality control and should get out as we forecast this weekend, and then next week we’ll keep ramping up production, so as many as 4 million tests next week are going to be driving forward. So, everything is on schedule for the tests.
