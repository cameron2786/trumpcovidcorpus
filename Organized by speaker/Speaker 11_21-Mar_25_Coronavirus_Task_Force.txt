Thank you, Mr. Vice President. We can keep hearing reports of competition among states that are trying to apply this necessary equipment onto a private market. And the Governor of Kentucky said yesterday that his state was in line to buy some equipment, but FEMA came in and purchased it from under them. So he says this is creating a problem for states because on the one hand they’re being told to get the equipment themselves if they can. But on the other hand, the federal government is buying up the supply chain. So is this a problem that you’re hearing about and what is your advice to states like Kentucky that are having this issue?
