So, if there is a summer sort of ebb with this virus, what would the federal government need to do to take advantage of that time to be better prepared for a possible resurgence in the fall than we were the first time?

What would you and other areas of the government need to do on testing, for example, or other things like that to be prepared that came back in the fall? How would you take advantage of the summer?
