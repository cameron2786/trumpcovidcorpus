Thank you Mr. Secretary and do you know, estimate how long this is going to take. That other pot of money obviously went quickly. Do you assume this is going to go quickly as well?

Mr. President, <crosstalk 00:00:04>, well I think you wanted to follow up on the hydroxychloroquine. I’m wondering if you’re concerned this VA study showed that actually more people died that used the drug that didn’t, and I’m wondering if Governor Cuomo brought you back any results.
<38:30>
A panel of experts at the NIH is actually now recommending against the use of hydroxychloroquine in combination with Z-Pak which is something you’ve recommended.

Another question for Dr. Birx, about the CDC director said in an interview that perhaps this second wave of the coronavirus in the fall could be worse because it is timed with the seasonal flu. Just wondering if you could talk about that in context of as you’re opening up the country and these guidelines that you’ve laid out.
<46:08>
But your message would be to prepare for that time thinking that it will come back together.
<01:04:09>
I wanted to follow up on what you said about the small business program. Harvard’s going to pay the money back. How confident are you that you can pull back money for <crosstalk 01:04:17>?
<01:12:33>
<crosstalk 01:12:33> Mr. President.
