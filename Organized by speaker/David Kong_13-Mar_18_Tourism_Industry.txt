We very much appreciate it. I’m the president and CEO for Best Western, and also World Hotels. We have about 5,000 hotels around the world, half the hotels are in the United States. We employ tens of thousands of employees in our company. As Chris has already alluded to, This is a very difficult time, and very challenging times for us. Just today on a call with one of our franchisees, he was lamenting that although he owns about 10 different hotels, and different brands, and some with us and some with other brands, he was lamenting, I’m going to lay off hundreds of people in his company, some of them have been with them for 20, 30 years and he was really concerned about their livelihood, and their safety net, and the other thing that he mentioned was if the government can help with liquidity, and access to capital, that would be of great assistance, and he specifically mentioned that his loans were swap loans and therefore there are severe penalties if you finance. And so if there’s any way to alleviate that burden-
