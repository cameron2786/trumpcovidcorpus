Yeah, so, I mean, I consider myself a relatively healthy individual. Probably get sick once every couple of years.
<12:30>
And to think that I had something like this was very … kind of surprising. And I think that, to think that you have a virus after being such a healthy individual, you kind of—
<12:40>
So I travel a lot, and I had the flu a little bit, so I think my immune system was compromised while I was traveling and it could’ve been just kind of community transfer. It’s been … Just accepting that I had it, I think, was the very hardest part, but then for something like that to take me down for almost eight days of fever and then three days of shortness of breath—
<13:00>
I’ve never felt this bad in my most recent recollection. I think that—
<13:12>
Never felt these symptoms before for this long.
<13:22>
Yep. And I only took Tylenol the entire time. I took a lot of it. I think the most frustrating part, honestly, was trying to get a test. I think that going to numerous places and being turned away by a sign on the door that says don’t come in here if you have these symptoms, I think that was a little—
<13:39>
This was early March, so I think part of the challenge was there was a lot of people saying a lot of different things and kind of knowing what to believe, where to go, you kind of go in circles a lot.
<13:51>
I think on March … Probably about seven or eight days into my fever, I found out. I got the test eventually, and it’s kind of interesting; there’s certain key words that, when you say those at an ER, they automatically treat you differently. So, for me, it was more of an education for a lot of my friends and family—
<14:13>
For me, it was more of, “I have a fever and I’ve been in San Francisco.” Those two, basically—
<14:25>
They treated me like I had COVID. So they sat me outside of the ER to make sure that I don’t become contagious and infect other people, and I waited out for a little bit, and then they came in and they swabbed me and stuff like that. So they did kind of take me a lot seriously and they got me a test, they got me an influenza test. So I think it’s one of those things that, there’s a lot of unknowns, there’s a lot of questions as to who to test, who not to test, and I think, at that time, there was a lot of people providing recommendations, and some of them were conflicting—
<14:58>
When I got the news that I had COVID, I think I had anxiety because there was so much going on, and I think that kind of accelerated my shortness of breath symptoms. The second day, I kind of felt that something was wrong, I need to go in the hospital. I didn’t necessarily think I was going to die, but I’ve never felt this bad before, and I think I needed medical attention.
<15:20>
I did. I got a pulse ox meter, and just having one of those and knowing that your oxygen levels are normal, it’s like a kind of confidence builder that you’re not going downhill.
<15:33>
Mine was always above 95%.
<15:40>
Yep.
<15:43>
Probably around day 11 I had gotten better.
<15:56>
I think just letting people know—
<17:05>
Yeah.
<17:11>
34.
<17:15>
Thank you.
