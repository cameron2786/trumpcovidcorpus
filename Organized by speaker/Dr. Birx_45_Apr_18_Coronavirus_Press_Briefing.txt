Well, as I described, we go Metro by Metro, County by County and so I’d have to link that with a specific County and look at their case rates. I believe the governor and the public health system that Florida has, they have some of the best County public health individuals I have ever had to deal with. They are amazing, as I had to work with them under HIV AIDS. So if the County health directors believe that that’s appropriate for their County, then I’m not going to second judge an individual’s approach to this. Because I can’t see into every single County and load the low rates. I can just see there’s no cases. So I don’t know if that’s a County with very small cases or not, but I think their County health official would know.
