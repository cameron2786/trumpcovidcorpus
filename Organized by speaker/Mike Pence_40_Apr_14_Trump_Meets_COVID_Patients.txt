I just want thank all of these courageous Americans. Thank you for being willing to be here and share your story. It is a tribute to your resilience. It’s tribute to those healthcare workers, Mark, that you were talking about that we’re there for you. And just the president and I wanted to have a chance to see all of you and let the country hear your stories. Because, while we rightly as a nation, reflect on the more than 23,000 Americans who have succumbed to the Coronavirus, as a tribute to our healthcare workers, we also do well to reflect on more than 44,000 Americans who have fully recovered. And you’re among them.

And so, I want to thank you for sharing your story. It truly gives hope to families that are looking on who have a loved one who is struggling with Coronavirus today. And I just want to promise you that this president and this vice president and our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force are going to continue to work every day and have more stories like yours across this nation, until we put the Coronavirus in the past and eventually someday have a vaccine that ends this once and for all.
