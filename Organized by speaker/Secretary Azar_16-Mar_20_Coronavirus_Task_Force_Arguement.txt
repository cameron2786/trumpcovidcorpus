So first, we’re making tremendous progress in terms of lab testing. Tens of thousands of tests are being done every single day, both through the CDC and the public health labs as well as now through the private sector commercial labs. They’re getting to scale, they have supplies, they have high throughput. We do hear anecdotally occasionally of say a public health lab or another one that has a concern about this supply or that supply.

Through FEMA, we actually are standing up a laboratory task force to answer those questions. Usually it’s that the lab people do not understand that there are actually alternative supplies in the marketplace that they are perfectly free to use. We’ve actually had to put out some common myths and truths about that.

For instance, the other day we were getting calls from governors saying we don’t have swabs. There are no swabs. There are no swabs. Our supply people went in the open marketplace and bought 200,000 swabs in the open market and I just sent a letter to every governor sending them swabs. So some of it’s just they aren’t listening or checking with us about all the freedom, all the capacities out there.

It’s a complex system with 330 million Americans and all of these labs, so sometimes there’s a lab that doesn’t understand how much flexibility they have and how much supply there is out there and we’re working through the new FEMA integration center to help correct that for folks.
