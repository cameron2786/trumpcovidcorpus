Thank you. Mr president. You mentioned the stock market earlier. To go back to that, to be clear, the Dow Jones dropped more than 2000 points this week. Are you suggesting that that was overblown? Are financial markets overreacting here?
<43:03>
You don’t think the selloff had to do with the Coronavirus?
<44:17>
At what point would you be considering loosening the travel restrictions regarding China.
<45:04>
<inaudible 00:45:04> consistently called for enormous cuts, the CDC, the NIH and the WHO. You talked a lot today about how these professionals are excellent, hypercritical if necessary. Does this experience at all give you pause about those consistent cuts?
<46:06>
Thank you Mr. President. So far your administration-
<46:11>
Is only testing less than 500 people. And health officials are questioning whether that’s enough comparing to other countries who have tested more than tens of thousands of people. Are you planning to test more people?
<47:14>
Two weeks ago Mr. President, your acting OMD director was in this room and was talking about what he expects to be GDP growth for this coming year. He said it was 3%, and we’ve talked about the effects of the Coronavirus on the supply chain, the declines in the financial markets. Are you still confident that you’ll see that kind of economic growth this year?
<49:57>
Thank you, sir. A number of your supporters online have embraced these theories or forwarded these theories that the CDC may be exaggerating the threat of coronavirus to hurt you politically. Rush Limbaugh the other day said this has been advanced to weaponize the virus against you.
<50:15>
Right, your opponents.
<50:17>
Have you seen evidence of that?
<50:58>
Have you seen evidence that the CDC is trying to hurt you?
<51:27>
Thank you Mr. President.
<51:34>
Thank you Mr. President. Tonight you’re minimizing the risk of danger or the virus. Are you telling the Americans, except for the ones who are sick, not to change any of their behaviors?
<52:39>
Thank you Mr. president.
<52:44>
It’s really nice to talk to you without the helicopter. But also I want to talk to you about 2014. During the Ebola crisis, you said you wanted a “Full travel ban.” You said Obama was a quote unquote stubborn dope not for doing it. You said just stop the flights dummies. You also said it was a quote unquote total joke to appoint someone to lead the Ebola response with “Zero experience in the medical field.”
<53:10>
I did. So how does that square with what you’re doing now.
<53:54>
Mr. President, let me ask you this.
<54:02>
And just the course of the last couple of minutes, you have disputed some of what the officials that are working in your administration behind you have said about the risk of Coronavirus and its spread. Do you trust your health officials to give you good information or do you trust your instincts more?
<54:49>
Mr. President, Brazil has its first case.
<54:54>
Right, Brazil. And you have many Americans now in Brazil for Carnival. What are your concerns and what are the procedures and practices that you plan to implement as those Americans are trying to come back home?
<56:07>
Thank you very much. You’ve said repeatedly that you think the federal government is very prepared, that you’re ready for this, but if you think that Secretary Azar is doing such a great job, why did you feel the need to make a change and put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the federal response to this virus?
<57:11>
Thank you, Mr. President. I want to get to China. At the beginning of this outbreak, the Chinese communist party covered it up. That has been the general consensus of everyone. How can you now legitimately trust President Zi and the Chinese communist regime-
<57:31>
to be forth coming and forthright with this <inaudible 00:57:41>?
<58:36>
<inaudible 00:58:36> flu has a fatality ratio of about 0.1%.
<58:40>
This has a fatality ratio of somewhere between 2 and 3%.
<58:50>
There’s more people who get the flu, but this is spreading or it’s going to spread maybe within communities.
<58:55>
That’s expectation. Does that worry you? Because that seems to be what worries the American people.
<59:31>
Mr. President, there’ve been many cases of price gouging on the sales of medical equipment mast and so-on. Should the government be investigating that, looking into it? Do you have a message on that.
<59:51>
Are you working with China right now? Specifically in what areas?
<01:01:04>
So, you don’t feel like you’re being replaced?
<01:01:16>
Will you answer a few more questions?
