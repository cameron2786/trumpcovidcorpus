Thank you, sir. I’d like to ask questions both for myself and some of the other reporters who are in the room. Social distancing. First of all, and this is for yourself and Dr. Birx, what percentage of the population do we suspect to be asymptomatic at this point? Is there a way to figure that out? It seems like the antibody test might be able to assist in determining that number.
