<56:10>
<crosstalk 00:56:10> death if we continue with these strict guidelines than if we ease them?
<56:34>
I had two questions. I had two questions for you, Mr. President. My second one is on what your economic advisor, Larry Kudlow said today. He was talking about this and he said that there were going have to be some difficult trade-offs if you do use these guidelines because he wants the economy to <crosstalk 00:56:46>.
<56:47>
No, no. He was saying, he was talking about how you said, you know, the cure shouldn’t be worse than the problem, and he was talking about reopening the businesses, getting the economy, going back and going again. What are those difficult trade-offs?
<57:45>
<inaudible 00:57:45> question is we’re seeing an increase of cases in Latin America and the Middle East-
<57:51>
In some places in Asia. Are you considering a new round of travel ban?
<58:12>
<crosstalk 00:02:15>. Mr. President, just quickly, a second question. What prompted you to say at the beginning of your beginning of your comments that you’re going to take care of the Asian Americans? Has there been something in particular that was <crosstalk 00:58:26> you?
<58:40>
Do you think you’re contradicted here?
<58:43>
<crosstalk 00:58:43> Chinese virus?
<58:54>
You say you want to reopen the country, but most schools across the country are closed. Two States now are closed for the rest of the school year. How are parents supposed to go back to work and educate their children right now?
<59:42>
Do you agree with the decision to close it several months out at this point? Because governors are saying they’re expecting a peak in the next couple of months and have the decision for the rest of the year.
<59:56>
Sir, will you explain why a $2 trillion economic stimulus is needed if you are going to reopen the country in a period of weeks, not months?
<01:01:32>
<inaudible 01:01:32> But does it still need to don’t make me $2 trillion is my question. Can it be smaller at this point?
<01:03:32>
If we can just clarify with Dr. Birx, we seem to be talking about different geographical slopes on this. The curve would be changing. And yet you just said that 20% numbers coming out of New York gives an indication that we don’t quite know when the seeds, to use your metaphor, were planted. How confident are you on the start dates of each curve for each of the geographical areas that the president seems to be indicating, will be adjusting the policy for?
<01:05:54>
Dr. Birx?
<01:05:56>
Dr. Birx, when will the government roll out the antibody tests so people can know possibly if they’ve been exposed?
<01:07:55>
Dr. Birx, a question about the serology blood tests, which some people have said hold some real promise here. When will those be FDA approved and when would they be widely available?
<01:08:32>
Realistically, how long until that’s approved and available? Would you-
<01:08:42>
It sounds like a while, then?
<01:10:48>
Dr. Birx, I’m wondering if you could comment on the new measures that Britain has put into place. Also, Germany has said it doesn’t want to have crowds of less than two people except for families, which is a pretty restrictive number. Does that inform your thinking as you are coming up with advice for this next period for the president and the vice president?
<01:12:09>
What do you think of Germany and Britain’s moves?
<01:12:27>
Dr. Birx, just to be clear, do you agree with the president’s push to reopen the country? He said some of his doctors that he’s talking to about this, he says, “I think they’re okay with it.” Are you okay with that?
<01:13:16>
And now, you think you could in a week, like what would your assessment be of right now looking forward?
<01:13:44>
What is the number?
<01:14:35>
Do you have an estimate? Do you have a number?
<01:20:07>
What advice Dr. Fauci-
<01:20:13>
Dr. Birx, can I have one more question?
<01:20:18>
Thank you. There’s still one week left to go and 15 days to slow the spread. Doesn’t talk of reopening the government quickly undermine that? I mean why would anyone today still social distance or not run out to see the Cherry Blossoms?
<01:21:48>
Mr. President, <crosstalk 01:21:49> what are your thoughts on Fauci today?
<01:21:54>
Sir, one thing some public health officials have said would be helpful is to open back up the ACA exchanges so that people who are worried about perhaps getting treatment could go sign up for insurance now, even though the open enrollment period is open, that’s something you can do with <crosstalk 00:26:12>.
<01:22:17>
Where is Dr. Fauci right now? Why is he not at this briefing? Will he attend future ones? And-
<01:22:32>
Does he agree with you about the need to reopen the the economy soon?
<01:23:33>
Mr. President-
<01:25:19>
All right. So quarter two, we know it’s going to be brutal. Who are you listening to? Where is the brain trust to help get us through that period? Also, has your opinion of the chair <crosstalk 01:25:29>-
<01:25:29>
Quarter two, the second quarter. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, they’re all predicting a pretty dire second quarter. Who are you listening to? Where’s the brain trust? You have all these medical advisors.
<01:26:55>
So you won’t give us one name of someone else you’re listening to?
<01:27:03>
<crosstalk 01:27:03> spigot today-
<01:27:04>
So are you happy over the Fed now that he’s turned on the spigot?
<01:28:01>
Mr. vice president, you said that you’d bring the secretary of education here either yesterday or today. Why isn’t she here today and can we expect for this week? Also, yesterday you said you have some guidance for us and people who had potentially been exposed to the virus returning to work sooner. You still expect their guidance.
<01:30:15>
We’ll see her to see.
<01:30:16>
We’ll see her this week.
<01:41:29>
Back to the stimulus. Can I ask a question on behalf of my radio pool colleague Tamara Keith from NPR, she asked me to ask this to you. You just mentioned that there was some things last night that were unacceptable, which would have been bad for the country that the Democrats were bringing into the stimulus conversation. Her question was what provisions would you absolutely not support in this plant right now?
<01:42:19>
She also wants to know how much would you want the cash relief directly for Americans, what number would you like to <crosstalk 01:42:24>?
<01:45:27>
One of the sticking points on the stimulus. Who’s going to hold treasury accountable for this $500 billion corporate recipe fund?
<01:46:11>
<inaudible 01:46:11> with fun, it’s about the lack of oversight. The treasury has these unilateral authority to dual out all of this money.
