Our basic message, in terms of the containment of this disease and the measures that we have and are to take <inaudible 00:20:35> today announcing is we want to lower the amount of travel to and from the most impacted areas. This is a basic containment strategy. That is the philosophy behind the moves that we have taken, the moves we’re announcing today and any moves that we will consider in the future. With that said, let me turn things over to Dr. Tony Fauci, the director of the national Institute of allergy and infectious disease at NIH. Thank you very much.

Thank you very much Mr. Secretary. I want to first, again as the entire team feels to extend our sympathies to the family of the individual who expired as a result of this particular virus and this particular disease, but I also want to underscore and emphasize the points that the secretary made about what is evolving here. You’ve heard of the terminology community spread. Well, community spread is when you have infection in the community in which you don’t have a direct link to a known index case. That really challenges us with something that we need to do and that we do very well. The state and local health authorities, in collaboration with the CDC, would need to identify, isolate and contact trace and that’s what’s going on right here in the country with regard to the particular area that’s involved now in Washington. The country as a whole, because we get asked that all the time, still remains at low risk, but when we say that we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation and in real time we will keep you appraised of what is going on just the same way as what we are doing it today.
