Are you considering all a nationwide stay at home order? I know there’s a lot of states that have put them in place, but some haven’t. I’m just wondering if you were considering some sort of broad stay at home order. And then I have a question for Dr. Birx too, if you don’t mind.

Can I ask a quick question for Dr. Birx <inaudible 00:43:23>?

So Dr. Birx, if you don’t mind, you had mentioned today that this model that predicts 100, 000 deaths is if we do things almost perfectly. So I wanted to know, are we currently doing things almost perfectly or are there more things we need to be doing to not exceed that 100,000, 200,000 model.
