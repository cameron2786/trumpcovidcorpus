Mr. President, thank you. Two for you and one for Dr. Hahn. The American Hospital Association just told NBC News that they need $100 billion dollars in order to adjust shortages in equipment and other infrastructure there. You just signed two legislative packages. They say it didn’t directly give money to address this issue. Why not? And will you commit to making sure they get the money they need?
