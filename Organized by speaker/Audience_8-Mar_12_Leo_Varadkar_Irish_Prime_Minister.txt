Mr. President, can you confirm the <inaudible 00:03:34> from your travel ban, Europeans <inaudible 00:03:38>?
<04:04>
<crosstalk 00:04:07>.
<04:38>
Mr. President, there were many European leaders who were upset that they weren’t consulted about the travel ban. Can you explain your rationale for not consulting with them first before announcing it last night?
<05:28>
Do you have any idea what the overall economic impact of these travel restrictions will be?
<06:27>
<inaudible 00:06:30>. What are your plans, Mr. President, about campaign rallies, about travel outside the White House? You originally had some travel on the schedule for tonight.

As far as workers, what are you looking at to help American workers?
<09:11>
<crosstalk 00:09:12>.
<09:21>
When will you decide though for the American workers what steps-
<10:16>
Do you support the House bill? The House Democrat bill?

Will Irish citizens always be welcome to <inaudible 00:10:34>?

Do you support Irish citizens getting access to the <inaudible 00:10:58>?

They’re concerned about Huawei <inaudible 00:11:08> operations <inaudible 00:11:11> Ireland.
<11:24>
Mr. President, can Americans still bring back the coronavirus in this new travel restriction?
<11:29>
Can Americans still bring back coronavirus?
<12:51>
Speaking of Iran, Mr. President, the Pentagon has determined that an Iranian backed militia fired the rocket that killed two American soldiers in Iraq. Should they expect a response?
<13:23>
Mr. President, would you like to see the Prime Minister return to the white house next year? He’s trying to form a governments at home. Would you like to see him <crosstalk 00:13:29>.
<13:51>
Would you like to see Mr. President re-elected in November?
<14:02>
Mr. President, there’s a report that a <inaudible 00:14:06> Brazil’s Bolsonaro may have the coronavirus. Are you aware of that? Because you were in contact with that person over the weekend.
<14:41>
Well, I’m asking you what update you can provide.
<14:45>
Mr. President, yesterday we heard from an emergency room physician in Houston who had a patient who was showing symptoms of something, tested negative for the flu. This physician wanted to test this person for coronavirus and got caught in what this doctor described as an infinite loop of stupid trying to get through to the public health agencies in Texas trying to get permission for this person to be tested. Is there something you can do as the president to try to cut through those bottlenecks?
<15:28>
<crosstalk 00:15:31>.
<15:37>
<crosstalk 00:15:39>.
<15:54>
This person did contact the correct authorities, but they were closed for the day, then he was on hold for an hour or simply trying to get a test.
<16:28>
<crosstalk 00:16:31>. You’re not going to Speaker Pelosi’s annual lunch. Can you tell us why?
<16:37>
Mr. President, <inaudible 00:16:38> 30 days on Europe. Is it possible you can extend it?

Is that, what percent <inaudible 00:16:58>.
<17:07>
<crosstalk 00:17:10>.
<18:49>
Mr. President, clearly you’re not being advised <inaudible 00:18:52> small groups like this, but is-
<19:02>
I’m wondering, has the White House medical officer or the Secret Service counseled you against straying too far from the White House?
<19:56>
Any more thoughts about the Tokyo Olympics?
<20:24>
<inaudible 00:00:20:28>.
<20:50>
They canceled.
<21:05>
Would you make that recommendation to your friends <inaudible 00:00:21:09>?
<21:19>
Mr. President <inaudible 00:21:21>. Did you shake hands with the Ireland Prime Minister today?
<22:23>
Mr. President, could you talk about the trickle through effect of everything that we’re seeing here? It’s like when you cancel an NBA season, you’re losing all of the revenue from the teams, the vendors. I mean it’s that way all through the entire economy.
<23:12>
Mr. President <inaudible 00:23:16> Joe Biden <inaudible 00:00:23:18>. Are you happy to <inaudible 00:23:19>?
