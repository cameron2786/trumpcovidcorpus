Thank you, sir. A question for you and for Dr. Fauci, if you’ll let me. Both Republican and Democrat packages of the stimulus, included $25 million worth of funding for the Kennedy Performance Art Center, here in Washington, DC. Shouldn’t that money be going to masks, respirators?

Another question, sir.

And then earlier today, Senator Marco Rubio told RCP that, “The World Health Organization showed favoritism to China.” and then Representative Michael McCaul, the ranking member on the house foreign relations committee, he questioned the integrity of the World Health Organization’s director, saying, “That there were several red flags in his past with respect to his relationship with China.” Do you agree? Do you think the World Health Organization showed favoritism and then once all the dust settles, do you think that the United States should re-explore its relationship with the World Health Organization?

Praising China’s transparency, sir?

World Heath Organization praising China for its transparency and leadership on their response to the pandemic?
