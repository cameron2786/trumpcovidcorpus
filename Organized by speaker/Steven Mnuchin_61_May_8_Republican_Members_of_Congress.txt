Thank you Mr. President. I want to thank everybody around the table. I’ve had the opportunity to speak to almost all of you, and all of your ideas. As others who’ve said it’s the president’s economic policies that led us to great success. I have the utmost confidence, we have the greatest scientists, the greatest medical people. There will be a vaccine. We will kill this virus. And the policies that you put in place recently are protecting American workers and American business as we go through this difficult time. So thank you Mr. President.
