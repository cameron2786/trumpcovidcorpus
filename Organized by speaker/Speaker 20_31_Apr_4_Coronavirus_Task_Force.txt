Mr. President, can you clarify the situation with 3M right now? Germany said that it was an act of piracy that 200,000 masks were apparently diverted from Thailand to the United States instead of to Berlin. Is that a miscommunication? Did that actually happen? And should 3M be fulfilling contracts?

Could you just clarify about that German order?
<01:01:39>
Was that diverted, sir, or what that not diverted?
