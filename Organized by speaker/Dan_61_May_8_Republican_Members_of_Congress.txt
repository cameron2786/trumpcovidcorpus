I just want to thank everybody in this room for the past three and a half years for supporting our president and the administration and everything you’ve done. This man goes 18, 20 hours a day, as many of you know, he’s the most transparent president in history. He’s the most accessible too, there’s nobody in this room that can’t call or get through to him. Mornings, evenings, mid-day. But we love you all and thank you so much on behalf of everybody here in the White House for everything that you’ve done supporting our president, means the world. Thank you.
