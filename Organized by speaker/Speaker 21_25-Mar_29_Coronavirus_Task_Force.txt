Okay. Thank you so much Mr. President.

I wanted to ask you more specifically about the strategy that you plan to unveil on Tuesday, what factors are you taking into consideration? What can the American people expect? And is it possible that these April 30th guidelines could be extended?

Thank you, Mr. President. You’ve also said that at one point that you thought more people might die from the economic tragedies, and the economic problems in America due to the coronavirus outbreak, what health officials are telling you that, and Dr. Fauci could you speak to that idea that there might be mental health and suicide related to this, would that outpace at some point the virus’s impact on the society? Thank you.
