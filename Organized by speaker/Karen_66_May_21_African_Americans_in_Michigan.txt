… as well as being able to… as you addressed about the historical black colleges, I would love to see a historical black college in the city of Detroit, I think that would be amazing. And I think you’re just the president to be able to make that happen.
<34:15>
I think that you can make that happen.
<34:21>
I think you can make it happen.
<34:23>
I would love to talk about.

Also, funding for home repairs for our seniors. Our seniors are really struggling and everyone does not have children. Everyone does not have a spouse and they don’t have family they can count on. So our seniors are suffering because they do not have money for repairs for their roofs, for ramps and for their porches. And that’s something that’s extremely important to them and to be able to maintain, as you know, to be able to maintain seniors in their homes is life changing.

I mean, we have programs that assist, but we don’t have programs that directly address this within the community to be able to empower seniors to stay in their homes. And I think we can make a whole world of difference by doing that. And you’ve considered everything else that I wanted to talk about.

Oh, I know it’ll happen. I mean, John James is the man to make that happen. We’ve been working really great together and I’m looking forward to continue working with you and the White House to be able to continue and Ja’Ron has been awesome to work with. So I thank you.
<35:58>
I will, he’s actually in the car.
<36:15>
He only saved my life.
<36:30>
No, and I also took a note from you and so I actually filed a lawsuit to the governor today as well. So I thought that you would like to know that.
<36:39>
Yes, I do.
