Mr. President, a question for you and a question for Dr. Fauci, if I could.
<41:27>
There’s been some concern among Democrats on Capitol Hill that the phase three fiscal stimulus is weighted too much in favor of corporations and not enough in terms of individuals. What did your conversations with Senator Schumer yield on that front?
<42:10>
Are you and Senator Schumer-
<42:14>
Are you on same page with Senator Schumer?
<42:19>
To Dr. Fauci, if I could? Dr. Fauci, as was explained yesterday, there has been some promise with hydroxychloroquine as potential therapy for people who are infected with coronavirus. Is there any evidence to suggest that, as with malaria, it might be used as a prophylaxis against COVID-19?
<43:55>
It was also apparently effective against SARS.
<44:11>
Was there anything to compare it to?
<48:19>
Want to get back to the science and the logistics here-
<48:21>
The units that were ordered, are they for clinical trials? Are they for distribution to the general patient population?
<48:49>
This would fall under the modified hospice-
<48:52>
This would-
<49:01>
I understand all that. I’m just thinking the application here. That would be under a modified compassionate access?
<50:01>
Is there any reason to believe it’s not safe?
<50:03>
Is there any reason to believe it’s not safe?
<01:33:29>
Let me just ask this in a very simple way. What is the demand pressure on testing in this country and are we meeting it?
<01:34:21>
So is that a way of saying we are not yet at a point where we are meeting the demand pressure?
