Thanks so much Mr. secretary. As you know, this has been a difficult, and challenging time, and our hearts go out to the individuals who have been directly affected by the virus, and to all those who’ve been working tirelessly in responding to it. Our aggressive containment strategy here in the United States has been working, and is responsible for the low levels of cases that we have so far. However, we do expect more cases and this is a good time to prepare. As you heard, it’s the perfect time for businesses, healthcare systems, universities and schools to look at their pandemic preparedness plans, dust them off, and make sure that they’re ready, and we have lots more information at the CDC’s website and in partnership on how to do that.

But, it’s also a really good time for the American public to prepare, and for you to know what this means for you. The coronavirus that we’re talking about is a respiratory virus. It’s spread in a similar way to the common cold, or to influenza. It’s spread through coughs and sneezes, and so, those everyday sensible measures that we tell people to do every year with the flu are important here; covering your cough, staying home when you’re sick, and washing your hands. Tried and true, not very exciting measures, but really important ways that you can prevent the spread of respiratory viruses.

The trajectory of what we’re looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain, but many of the steps that we have taken over the past 15 years to prepare for pandemic influenza, and our experience going through the 2009 H1N1 pandemic of influenza remind us of the kinds of steps that our healthcare system, our businesses, our communities and schools may need to take. We’re in this together, all of government, the public, and the private sector, and the CDC wants to make sure you have the best information available every day. Thank you.
