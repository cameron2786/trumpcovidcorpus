A question on the clinical data. We’ve had now roughly 5,000 people test positive. We’ve had 90 deaths or so. When are we going to know the data of who those people are? Who has been infected? What the ages are? What the preexisting conditions are? How serious it was both for those who have been tested positive but also those who have died?

Will you commit to making that data public so we will all know?
