I have a question for you as well, the governor of South Carolina announced today, they’re going to open some stores with restrictions, but they just told my colleague <Natasha Chin 00:02:50> that they have not achieved that criteria in The White House guidelines about the downward trajectory for 14 days. So, shouldn’t they not be reopening stores today?
