Mr. Vice President, thank you so much. I have a question for you and if I can for Dr. Berks first. First for you, sir, if I may. Your language has changed a bit. You’ve tweaked it a little bit. Early on you said that there was a low risk for the average American to contract the Coronavirus.

Recently, your language has altered a little bit. You’re saying the risk of a serious illness remains low. Can you address why the change, is the potential of contracting the virus for an average American no longer low? Why the change, sir?

Which sir and you are the Vice President, if you don’t mind sir.
