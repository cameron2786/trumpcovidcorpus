<crosstalk 01:07:18> follow up with Dr. Birx for a moment. Dr Birx if you don’t mind, I just wanted to follow up on the question we were asking you about with social distance in some of these states. So with Georgia opening back up, things like tattoo parlors, getting a massage, social distancing maybe there are some creative ways, but it seems very difficult to do social distancing. So do you have a message for people in Georgia who are soon going to have a choice about going to the hair salon or the nail salon or getting that tattoo if they’re not six feet apart and they’re not able to follow these social distancing guidelines? What’s your message to people in a state like Georgia?
