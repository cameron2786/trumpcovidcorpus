Arne Sorenson, CEO of Marriott. Thanks for giving us your time this afternoon, and appreciate the leadership of all of you as we go through this crisis. I don’t need to repeat much of what’s been said. We think we have about 750,000 people that wear our name badge around the world every day. Probably about two thirds of those in the United States.
<08:05>
1.4 million, just shy of 1.4 million hotel rooms. And as you know, the business is made up of hotels we run, often hotels are owned by other investors, but we will operate them. And then also by franchise operators. And they are typically owner operators. They might range from a Fairfield Inn in a suburban or rural market all the way up to a Ritz Carlton or a St. Regis someplace. And you asked about the globe. In January, of course this all starts in China. Business falls by 90%.
<08:39>
All started in China.
<08:42>
Absolutely. Third week in January, and within a week-
<08:47>
Business is down about 90%. And you’ve been living this just the way we have. About three weeks ago, we have that horrible where it shows up to Korea and in Italy. They are sort of a clarion call, if you will, that it has left China, and it is moving to the rest of the world. And while we didn’t know exactly how it would show up in the United States, it was fairly clear that it was now a broader spread.
<09:15>
China, there’s starting to be some green shoots. So Macau for example, we think we bottomed at about 2% occupancy.
<09:22>
2%.
<09:23>
Yeah. And we think we might be approaching 30 as of last night. Now that’s probably one of the stronger markets in China.
<09:31>
They’re trying to get things going again, but we’re still in the rest of the world, including the United States, I get dailies, of course, of new reservations and cancellations. In every other market, the numbers are continuing to go down. So I don’t think we bottomed anywhere else yet. In the US, in the last couple of days anyway, when you look at decline in reservations, and in cancellations, the total is negative. So we’re losing business every day.
<10:04>
And of course we’ll have some time with you today, but employees first, and I think liquidity second is the two things that are on our list.
