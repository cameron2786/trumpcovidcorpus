Mr. Vice President, first of all, can you explain why secretary Azar is not here and also can you indicate to us, one of the things the President rolled out yesterday was discussion of Google partnering with the federal government and then later Google said it was not aware that this was going to be announced and that it was not prepared in the same way the President forecast to the country. So where’s the discrepancy about the website, Google’s involvement and why is the Health and Human Services Secretary not present?
