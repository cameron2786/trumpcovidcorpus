Thank you, sir. Can you explain the thinking behind these 100 ventilators that were given to Colorado when other states like Kansas have had trouble getting ventilators and can you say whether a personal relationship with president is helping states like Colorado get these ventilators? I mean there are 15 States that have more cases than Colorado.

Can you address whether individual governors’ with relationships with the president are getting preferential treatment.
