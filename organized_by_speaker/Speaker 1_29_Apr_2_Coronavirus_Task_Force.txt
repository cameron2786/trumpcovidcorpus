Mr. Secretary, Chase Bank sent a letter to its business clients today saying that they don’t have the necessary guidance from the SBA, from the Treasury Department to be able to accept loan applications starting tomorrow. The need is clearly enormous, but at least one major bank says they’re not fully empowered yet to be able to help there.

Thank you, Mr. Secretary. This is for, I guess both you and the administrator. There’ve been some anecdotal reports that business people are trying to get access to the online site to submit the applications. The website’s been crashing. I’ve heard of webinars going offline because there’s just too many people on them, so how are you guys going to be ready tomorrow to get these loans out?

A question for clarity about the direct payments to Americans. For those folks who don’t have bank accounts, who don’t have direct deposit information on file with the IRS, how long would they have to wait for their check?

So quickly is a matter of weeks then perhaps, not months?

A question for the administrator. Is there a certain category of small businesses that you’re most concerned about? Restaurants, hair salons, things like that?
<24:50>
Is there a certain segment that you think is particularly vulnerable?
