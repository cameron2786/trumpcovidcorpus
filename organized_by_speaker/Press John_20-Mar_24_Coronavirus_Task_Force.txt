Mr President, if you look at what we’ve just seen in the last day or so, you’ve seen the number of known coronavirus cases in the country double in just two days and another 95 people have died just in the last 24 hours. New York’s governor is saying this is running like a bullet train across the country and the governor of Louisiana is saying that his state, I may not be able to handle the cases that they’re facing by early April. So what are you seeing in all of this that leads you to think they we can reopen by Easter or even earlier?
