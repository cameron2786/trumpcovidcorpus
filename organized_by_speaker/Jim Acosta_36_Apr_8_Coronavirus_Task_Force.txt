I’m not weighing in on Tiger King.

Let me get back to you with the coronavirus, if I can, Mr. President. Last week, your top experts were saying that we should expect 100,000 to 240,000 deaths in this country. You’ve been talking about how it looks like maybe things are planned telling. Are these numbers now being revised downward? I know you don’t want people to stop social distancing and that sort of thing, but what can you tell us about the numbers? Are they right?

Yeah, I want to get back to something you were saying yesterday about people going to Wisconsin and voting in the middle of this pandemic. Really putting their lives on the line. And you said, “Well, if they do that, vote by mail, perhaps we’ll have voter fraud in this country.” I just wanted to ask you if the voters in five states, Utah, Colorado, Hawaii, Washington and Oregon, all vote by mail, can you or the White House staff or your campaigns provide any evidence to back up your claim, that mail-in voting is rife with fraud, like the example you gave of people working the rooms filling out false ballots?

We’ve been talking about so far, since the beginning of this administration. Where’s the evidence?
<46:04>
Voting doesn’t work out well for the Republicans. So is your concern really just political?
<46:38>
Where’s the proof of that?
