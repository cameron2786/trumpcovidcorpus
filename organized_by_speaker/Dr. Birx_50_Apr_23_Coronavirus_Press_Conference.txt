We’ve had outbreaks in specific prisons, we’ve had outbreaks in specific nursing homes. We’ve had outbreaks in specific plants and when that happens, that adds 2, 300, 400 cases on that single day. So we track very carefully not only what the country’s doing, but what each state is doing, each County is doing. And we look at delta changes across all of the counties so that we find early warning signals for these types of outbreaks. Because we want the whole country to go down, but we also want to prevent the outbreaks before they occur.
