Thank you Mr. President for all of the support for New York state. This has been a true partnership and the administration has stepped up, whether it’s ventilators or building the Javits center, which was tremendously important. My district in upstate New York, people are eager to get back to work safely. Our tourist businesses, our hotels have been devastated. So as we talk about this transition, making sure that we allow our small businesses to get back to work safely is so incredibly important. Also, our farmers, thank you to secretary Purdue for stepping up. We have dairy farmers in our district who are going through a crisis, but we know that you support the farmers and we’re appreciative of all of your work for New York. And I know you’ve worked effectively with Democrats and Republicans in New York state, so thank you.
