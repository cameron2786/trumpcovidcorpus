Mr. President, thank you for having us. We were delighted when you made the vice president the head of the Interagency Task Force. We believe in collaboration. We want to try to solve these problems both short and longterm. We’ve been sharing ideas with the vice president’s staff and your staff. We think there are better ways to trace the passengers coming in. We’ve contracted to have a mobile app and a website developed that everyone would have to fill out that would go directly to CDC with that information. And we’re moving forward with that. So there’s been good progress. I think what we all need is the reassurance that you and the vice president and others have been providing the travel is safe and that we can go forward because right now the fear is almost worse than the virus.
