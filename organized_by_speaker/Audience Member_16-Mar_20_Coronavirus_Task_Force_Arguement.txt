<01:15:03>
One week spread, so is $1,000 check going to cut it? Is that going to be?
<01:16:41>
On the issue of supplies, you’ve told governors to try to find whatever supplies they can on their own but some of them are now saying when they go to try to buy them, they’re being outbid by the federal government.
<01:17:56>
The labor department has told states not to disclose their numbers. Do you agree with that?
<01:18:03>
One more clarifying question if I could on the DPA. I just want to be clear. Are you saying that the administration is requiring these industries to create these products or just asking?
<01:18:35>
How can you help out states and localities that are trying to bid on things like ventilators and other items that are being outbid by the <inaudible 01:18:46>?
<01:19:15>
Do they know that they’re…
<01:19:28>
Mr. President just had a question for Secretary Azar. There are labs across the country that don’t have the testing supplies they need. What specific actions is the administration taking…
<01:19:41>
What specific action have they taken…
<01:22:48>
Mr president, you’re the head of the task force. You’ve seen the numbers, you’ve spoken to average Americans, you’re a former governor. What do you say to Americans right now who are watching and who are scared?
<01:24:13>
You just said that you haven’t had to require companies to up their production of medical supplies, but you’ve said last night you have invoked DPA. I’m confused…
<01:25:09>
This is important. You haven’t actually directed any companies to start making more ventilators or masks.
<01:25:17>
How many?
<01:25:25>
Mr. President, partially following up on that, are there auto makers right now who are retooling their production facilities to make ventilators or <inaudible 00:10:34>.
<01:25:55>
This is a question for you, partially for Secretary Azar. You said yesterday that you had spoken to Carnival corporation’s chairman? Yes. And he said that he could donate some shifts.
<01:27:02>
So, so right. So my question is one, it sounds like you haven’t taken them up on it yet…
<01:27:10>
And secondly…
<01:27:14>
The cruise ships have a lot of frequently contacted surfaces and so this is where you come in, Secretary Azar, potentially Dr. Fauci Do you have concerns about those cruise ships being used as hospitals?
<01:27:44>
Why not just use hotels?
<01:27:48>
Well that’s what I’m asking. Why not just use hotels?
<01:28:02>
Thank you. A quick follow up. So can you say, can you name any of the companies that you’ve asked to start making these ventilators or face masks?
<01:28:18>
Okay, well thank, and this is for Dr. Fauci…
<01:28:31>
Okay, thank you. And so for Dr. Fauci, there’s new research out that the CDC has released that many of the people that have, or that 13% of the people with the Coronavirus got it from someone that was asymptomatic. So my question is, does that change the way the approach that should be taken? And do you think that’s the case or do you think that, or do you not agree with that research?
<01:29:33>
Thank you, Mr. President, I have a question about testing. When will every American who needs a test get a test and be able to get a test and why not have medical equipment being shipped right now to hospitals who need it?
<01:30:37>
There are Americans though who say that they have symptoms and they can’t get tested.
<01:30:41>
What do you say to the Americans who are scared <inaudible 01:30:45>?
<01:30:50>
So, I would ask Dr. Fauci, because Kevin <inaudible 01:30:54> is one of the people who is now suggesting that the real way to get to the end of this, for life to return to normal, is for every single person living in this country to be tested. That way you could see who’s contagious and you could then have people who don’t have it go back to work. Is there any possibility that this country could ever get to a point where every single person could be tested and how long would that take?
<01:38:04>
They say that by the end of the month, they won’t have basic medical supplies.
