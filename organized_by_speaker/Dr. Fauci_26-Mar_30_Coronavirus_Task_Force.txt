In fact, I would anticipate that that would actually happen because of the degree of transmissibility. However, if you come back in the fall, it will be a totally different ballgame of what happened when we first got hit with it, in the beginning of this year. There’ll be several things that will be different. Our ability to go out and be able to test, identify, isolate and contact trace, will be orders of magnitude better than what it was just a couple of months ago. In addition, we have a number of clinical trials that are looking at kind of variety of therapeutic interventions. We hope one or more of them will be available.

And importantly, as I mentioned to you many times at these briefings is that, we have a vaccine that’s on track and multiple other candidates. So I would anticipate that a year to year and a half, we’d be able to do it under an emergency use. If we start seeing an efficacy signal, we may be able to even use a vaccine at the next season. So things are going to be very different. What we’re going through now, is going to be more than just lessons to learn, it’s going to be things that we have available to us that we did not have before.
