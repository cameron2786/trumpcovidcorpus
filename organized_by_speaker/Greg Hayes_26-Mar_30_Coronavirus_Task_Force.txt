Good afternoon. I’m Greg Hayes from United Technologies and on behalf of the 240,000 employees of United Technologies and the 70,000 employees at Raytheon, which will join together with UTC this Friday, I want to first of all say thank you to the president and the vice president for your leadership during what is really a war.
<25:14>
It was a different war than anybody has ever fought before, but it’s a war that we’re uniquely qualified to help. As one of the world’s largest defense contractors and some of the best technology, we’re using that technology to try and solve some real world problems.
<25:28>
Today we’re working with the Air Force to try and help the pilots as they’re moving medical evacuees with the COVID-19 virus such that they can be protected and that the patients can be protected.

Again, we’re working also with logistics and if you think about a war, strategy is important but logistics wins war. It’s imperative I think with FEMA and along with Mr. Navarro’s office, that we coordinate all of these activities.

Last week we donated about 90,000 pieces of personal protective equipment to FEMA. Next week we’ll have another almost million, again working through our supply chain partners around the world. We’re also today, this week, beginning the manufacture of face shields using the additive technologies that we have and the machines that we have available within UTC, we’ll be able to produce approximately 10,000 shields in the next four weeks. Again, all needed equipment.

We stand ready to help in any way we can. We don’t need the Defense Production Act to ask us to act. All of the people at UTC and Raytheon are focused on this war and winning it. Again, I also want to say thank you to all of our employees for their work during this crisis, as well as to the frontline medical and other first responders. Thank you very much.
