Dr. Birx, if I could just follow up. You all are signaling a much more aggressive posture toward containment mitigation now. Many states have been very aggressive, but there is a small number of states that have not issued public guidance to their residents. Is it important for the success of the effort that 100% of the states be forward-leaning on this? If so, Mr. President, what would be your message to those states that have not?
