That’s right.
<00:17>
I think we’re number one.
<00:41>
Thank you.
<01:07>
Yes. First of all, mister president to you and your team we’re incredibly honored to be here. I thank you for the enormous help in our darkest hour of need. Ventilators, as you can see, PPE testing sites. Now I think we’re going to be in a very good place thanks to you and your team as it relates to expanding testing dramatically so that we’ll be able to begin to take those steps to reopen. We’ve been crushed as a state, as you know, as a state you know very well. We have 6,770 fatalities, but the curves, thank God are beginning to show promise and we’re beginning to take some baby.
<01:48>
steps on that road to reopen. In fact, we’ve announced that as of this weekend, our state county parks golf under certain protocols as of Saturday morning will be able to be open again. And that’s a step on that road. And again, we couldn’t be making the progress we’re making without you and your administration and so to you and to your incredibly talented team with a very heavy dose of New Jersey blood on your team, including yourself, who knows the state extremely well. We thank you for everything. And again, financially that’s another topic, we’ve been crushed and I appreciate your consideration on the financial side going forward as well. So thank you for everything.
<02:35>
Amen.
<03:22>
Thank you mister president.
<03:24>
Honored to be with you and this is a big deal for us. Thank you.
<05:57>
Yep.
<07:38>
They did test me.
<07:42>
I’m negative.
<07:45>
The quick turnaround. I feel like a new man.
<09:27>
We did.
<09:30>
Yeah, I don’t know … I don’t have a view on the history, but I will say this. In our hour of need, whether it was ventilators, the Army Corps building out capacity, FEMA with our testing sites, and a big part of our ability to reopen as fast as we all want to is to rapidly expand testing.
<09:50>
And you all literally in the here and now this week are helping us in a big way to at least, I would expect by the end of May, thanks to you and your team’s help, we’ll be able to at least double, and I hope more than double our testing capabilities. And because of that, that will allow us to much more aggressively and responsibly do the reopening that we all need to do.
<10:19>
Yeah, we got them. I mean, there’s just no other way to put it and I’m told that we were the number one state recipient of that letters. And we were at the edge and this is life or death stuff and we got them and we’re forever thankful for that.
<13:52>
Yeah, so I’ve been in office two, going on two and a half years and I got elected to sort of fix the economy and we made a lot of progress on what I would call the legacy issues. Record pension payments, stabilizing indebtedness, record surpluses. And as Mike Tyson says, “Everyone’s got a plan until they get punched in the face.”
<14:12>
And we did. So we’ve got a plan and we’re comfortable with the progress that … It’s going to take a while, of the legacy stuff. The financial assistance we need, and we need a significant amount. This is a big hit, and this is somewhere in New Jersey alone could be 20 to 30 billion dollars, but this is to allow us to keep firefighters, teachers, police, EMS, on the payroll, serving the communities in their hour of need. And that’s something that we feel strongly about. We don’t see it as a bailout. We see this as a partnership doing the right thing in what is the worst healthcare crisis in the history of our nation. And I want to, again, thank the president for an extraordinary spirit of partnership across the whole spectrum of our needs. And I want to reiterate that. Thank you.

Thank you mister president.
