Mr. President I want to ask you about the new federal projections in a moment. But first today you tweeted “the invisible enemy will soon be in full retreat.” Given it’s invisible without widespread testing how would you know?
<44:35>
And how do you do that without the widespread testing, specifically my question.
<45:01>
I’ll ask you about the projections after. Thanks Mr. President.
<48:54>
Can I ask you about the new federal projections? There’s new reporting today, the new federal projections suggest-
<48:59>
I’d like to ask you if I can about the new federal projections that suggest lifting the 30 day shelter in place orders would lead to a spike in infections. Have you seen those new projections from your Department of Homeland Security and HHS?
<49:16>
They said that it would take place if the 30 day shelter in place were to be removed. There are three different examples.
<49:24>
Is that your thinking, though that those-
<49:30>
They didn’t leak it to us. It’s being reported by others.
<49:34>
It’s your administration, so I asked. It’s from the HHS and DOJ. I’ll circle back-
<49:47>
The New York Times just reported it within the last <crosstalk 00:49:49>.
<49:52>
I’m just telling you what I <crosstalk 00:49:54>.

I guess the question, Mr. President, should Americans have to decide between staying healthy and going back to work?
<01:48:32>
Mister president, we learned that more than 16 million Americans filed for unemployment over the past three weeks. It’s good Friday, it’s payday. We are seeing troubling, paralyzing lines at food banks around the country. What do you say to those Americans in need right this moment?
<01:50:01>
Let me ask you about that, if I can, just to follow up then. You chose not to do a national stay at home order. Now that you say you want to reopen parts of the economy, what authority do you have to do that? Is it ultimately up to the states to do that?
<01:51:14>
What authority do you have to reopen right now? The same way that’s up to the states to shut it down, it’s up to them to reopen.
