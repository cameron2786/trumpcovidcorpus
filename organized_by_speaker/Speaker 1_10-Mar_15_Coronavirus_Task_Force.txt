Mr. Vice President, we’ve seen a number of communities across the country that are starting to either close restaurants, some are even doing curfews. Do you envision this happening kind of nationwide where you’ll see some rules come to affect saying, “We don’t want people out at places they’re not… Essentially a Walmart or a grocery store of some kind or a testing center?” And then also I would be curious to see, we’ve also heard so many travelers today that were coming back from these airports, people that were flying back. They were so concerned, I’m sure the Secretary will address it, but these folks that are wondering now, did they catch it because they were stuck waiting in line for hours and hours of customs? Your thoughts on that, sir?
