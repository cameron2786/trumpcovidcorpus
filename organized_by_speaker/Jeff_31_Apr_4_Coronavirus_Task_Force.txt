Mr. President, ventilator manufacturers are doubling, tripling, even quadrupling their production in some cases.
<01:21:50>
Yet, medical experts and some of these manufacturers are predicting that there will still be shortages of tens of thousands of ventilators. Is it time for you to level with the American public that there likely will be shortages of ventilators in some cases?
<01:22:27>
Why is that a nasty question?
<01:24:25>
Herculean effort of some of these companies to ramp up production as fast as possible.
<01:24:29>
It still won’t be enough.
<01:25:53>
Follow up on what you and the others have been saying today about it being a deadly week or two coming. Can you give us a sense of perhaps <inaudible 01:26:01> of what that means numerically?
<01:26:37>
How many deaths exactly are you expecting?
<01:27:26>
When will that peak be?
<01:27:41>
Are you thinking tens of thousands of deaths in that period of time?
<01:28:46>
<inaudible 01:28:46> number?
<01:29:53>
You mentioned, just to follow up on something that apparently you said yesterday that you had some concerns about Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Washington DC. Could you expand on that?
<01:31:36>
<inaudible 01:31:36> Exactly what I said just before, and I keep repeating. Just make sure everybody does at least the minimal amount of that physical separation because the virus has no place to go if you’re physically separated.
