It’s nice to meet you, Mr. President.
<00:03>
He’s good.
<00:36>
Can I just start since day one? 60 days ago, we talked to supports on your staff around what the needs were, and it was around PPE. So, helping first responders but also clearly the charge for ventilators. So, maybe what I’ll do is just explain…
<01:17>
Yeah, well actually in three different facilities.
<01:18>
So, it’s over 1000 UAW workers, all volunteers that are helping out.
<01:26>
Mr. President, our first thing is we wanted to move very, very quickly. The need was to move very fast, things like how do we help people. And one of the first gains we had with the administration said that the urge to contract the tension from the eyes, and we thought how would we actually help out with somebody who’s wearing a mask with more protection, so face masks. So what you see behind you is essentially the first week, we were producing face shields. This is an example of a face shield, and…
<02:06>
It provides a…
<02:12>
This photo behind you is a-
<02:13>
Well, it’s a cleanable plastic, basically, which means it had produced at high speeds. So, this is four weeks later. It can give you a <inaudible 00:02:25>. In less than 30 days, we were building four million face shields a week at <crosstalk 00:02:32>.
<02:45>
Our leadership-
William Ford, Jr.: <02:45>
Well, we could for as long as it’s needed, I think.
<02:54>
Well, that was the thing that was-
<08:16>
It basically keeps the occupants safe. It takes in fresh air.
<08:16>
And we used automotive components, so we heard the message that we needed to go quickly. We built 32,000 of these respirators, and we’ve shipped 887 <crosstalk 00:08:28> –
<08:29>
If you walk around here, you can see the respirator. It just holds the respirator, so. On the first day when we had this conversation, in the drawing, we said how do we use automotive components to go quick? And so we got about a fan of a highly controlled seat in the F150. We take a battery pack off of a Dewalt tool from the battery source, and then a filter to filter the air for the occupant.
<09:16>
Ventilators, we’re ramping up to 6,000 a week.
<09:37>
So, we built 32,000 of these already.
<09:37>
So, we’ll be able to go 12,000 a week.
<09:46>
Basically this is the maximum protection for an occupant.
<09:48>
Maximum. It basically blows filtered air, filters out the virus over there over the occupant’s face, so if they’re in a large ICU ward, or they’re in one of these makeshift ICU wards, and there’s a lot of virus could be in the air, this would give them the maximum protection.
