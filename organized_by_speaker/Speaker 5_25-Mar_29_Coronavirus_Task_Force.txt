Thank you mister president. I would certainly like to echo my colleagues comments that the collaboration amongst many of the government agencies and the private market, the distributors represented here today has been incredible. It has been increasing and ramping up over the past weeks. Today’s first delivery of Operation Airbridge I think is the first evidence that it’s working. The 51 flights you referenced we’re excited about. We look to build upon that. So I would echo my thanks for your leadership and certainly to the staffs for the terrific partnership and the commitment to protect the people we think about most often, which are the people on the front lines providing care. And maybe just a quick word of thanks on behalf of all the CEOs here to our teams that continue to show up in warehouses across the country and pharmacies across the country and do their jobs to keep the supply chain going. The supply chain is working, it’s resilient. Supply is a challenge. We’re tackling that.
