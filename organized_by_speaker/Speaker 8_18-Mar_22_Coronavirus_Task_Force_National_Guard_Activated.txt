Speaking of the same thing, I think Kelly was kind of alluding to it, while we’ve been up here. They weren’t able to get the 60 votes to move the package for the cloture vote. I’m just curious, just your reaction to that sir, and then what is Mitch McConnell telling you and Secretary Mnuchin-
<57:43>
Sir, I apologize. There was a woman that was an American that was… Was she being tortured? What was going on there?
<58:29>
Can I ask you one more question, sir?
<58:31>
It’s something I’ve just been curious about. Previous crises, like the tsunami, Katrina, past presidents, they’ve called their predecessors and said, “Hey, I need you to step in,” do something like that. Do you have any interest in reaching out to presidents Bush, Obama, Clinton, Carter, or talking to them? I’m just curious if that’s something you consider enough.
<01:12:46>
Sorry, question, Surgeon General.
<01:14:18>
<inaudible 01:14:18] Sorry, Mr. Surgeon General. Question for you. We were talking about this before the briefing. A lot of folks, they’re watching TV, they’re reading up on this constantly. If you are not somebody who’s got a preexisting health condition, but all of a sudden you go, “All of a sudden, I just don’t feel 100%,” and then your mind just starts playing with you, right? You think, “Oh my god, I coughed three hours ago. Was that a first sign?” When should those people really start to say, “Okay, maybe I need to call the doctor.” Because you don’t want to flood them, but a lot of people that are probably healthy right now are thinking, “Whoa, wait. That’s all I’m hearing about. It’s all I can think about. When should I either call a doctor or get tested?”
<01:14:55>
Well, I hope not.
<01:15:46>
And Mr. Vice President, you got tested yesterday, I’m just curious, sir, can you tell us what that was like for you? A lot of people are going to be going through this. Were you standing by the phone? Were you just having an iced tea? What was that like and what did you do to kind of kill that time to keep your mind at ease?
<01:16:49>
What was that like for you, sir?
<01:18:00>
Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President.
