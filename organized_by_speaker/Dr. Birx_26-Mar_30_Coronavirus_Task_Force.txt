Thank you. Thank you. I think that’s a really great question. And tomorrow we’ll go through all of the graphs and all the information that we took to the president for the decision. But when you… and I just want to thank the data team that’s working day and night to get, I mean, I usually get my data about 2:00 AM from them and they assimilate all the data from all the states. And when you look at all of the states together, all of them are moving in exactly the same curves. And so that’s why we really believe this needs to be federal guidance so that every state understands that it may look like two cases today, that become 20, that become 200, that become 2000. And that’s what we’re trying to prevent. And I think states still have that opportunity, but they’re going to have to do all of these recommended… I mean, these recommendations are recommendations that the globe is using.

And so we really do recommend that every governor, every mayor, looks very carefully and ensures that their communities are utilizing these guidance.
