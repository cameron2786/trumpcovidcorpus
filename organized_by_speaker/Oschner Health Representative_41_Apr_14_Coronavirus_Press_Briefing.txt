Thank you Mr. President. It’s great to have Oschner Health be part of this program. We certainly have been a recipient and the State of Louisiana has been a recipient of help getting ventilators to our state and to Ochsner Health. We’re currently taking care of about 60% of the Covid patients in New Orleans and we did see a spike over the past few weeks, but we’re starting to get on the other side of that and heading in the right direction. I also want to thank you personally for helping Ochsner Health. A couple of weeks ago we were running short on surgical gowns and you and your team were able to direct some to New Orleans, which was helpful to us and other hospitals around the New Orleans area. So we’re excited to be part of this Dynamic Ventilator Reserve and we are proud to be a part of that and help other communities around the country. Thank you.
