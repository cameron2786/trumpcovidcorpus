Mr. President, do you have any comment on Rick Wright who says he’s going to file a whistleblower complaint?
<02:04>
I can comment on that, Mr. President.
<02:06>
So we authorized in the last Care Act over $10 billion of a loan. My team is already actively working on that with the postal service if they need the money, and we’re dealing with that.
<03:49>
I do. And actually we are going to put certain criteria for our postal reform program as part of the loan, and we’re looking forward to the board is recruiting a new postmaster general and doing postal reform.
<09:40>
The president has asked me to work with the secretary of energy and we’re looking at a whole bunch of alternatives. It would be premature for me to comment on any one of them, but the president has asked us to look at the range of alternatives.
<09:55>
Again, you can assume that’s one of the alternatives, but there’s many of them. <crosstalk 00:09:59>.
<10:20>
It is, Mr. President, as you’ve suggested.
