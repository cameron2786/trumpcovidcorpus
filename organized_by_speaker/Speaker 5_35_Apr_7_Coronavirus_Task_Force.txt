Thanks. A quick followup on that. So, is the time to freeze funding to the WHO during a pandemic of this magnitude?

I wanted follow up. You talked about African Americans and how they’ve been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus.

Do you plan on requiring the CDC, any federal agencies or state agents, public places doing tests and private companies doing tests to collect that data on the race of the people being tested and the race of the people being treated and the outcomes?
<33:53>
But you will release that publicly? Sue, would you like to talk about that for a second? Please.

Are you going to do something specifically aimed at those communities that are being hard hit, those black communities that are being hard hit?
