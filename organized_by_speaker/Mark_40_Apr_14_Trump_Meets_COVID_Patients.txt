<24:19>
Sure did.
<24:30>
I think he’ll do great. Coach Ariens is a guy that I have worked with him before with the Cleveland Browns. He’s going to love BA. They’ll work crate together.
<24:46>
Yep, sure did.
<24:56>
Absolutely not. No. He was a great college player, but I mean, look, they’re saying he’s the greatest of all time now.
<25:10>
Of course. So as a quarterback, the most important thing as being the quarterback of the United States is leadership. That’s the most important thing. He’s always had that and work ethic.
<25:48>
That’s correct.
<25:55>
Yeah. A crisis becomes opportunity.
<26:03>
Absolutely.
<26:09>
I played tight end.
<26:14>
Well, I didn’t say I was a fast tight end, I said I played tight end.
<26:19>
Yeah, I could catch a ball.
<26:24>
I would tell you I was probably more of a blocker.
<26:30>
Yeah, just under 6’6. Right now I’m about 252, I had the coronavirus diet, but I played at about 260, 265.
<26:47>
Yeah. Well mister president, if I may, from everybody at this table, I don’t think they’ll mind if I speak for them, we just want to applaud you and thank you both for your efforts the past three weeks. It’s been outstanding and we certainly appreciate it.
<27:28>
So I’m 44, like you mentioned, ex athlete, still worked out as much as I can. Not as hard as I used to, but still work out in shape. Essentially, I was driving with my family in Northern Michigan. I have three kids, Caden, Evan, and Case, and a wife, Michelle. Stop. The only thing I can think of that I did out of the ordinary, because none of them had, thank God, never had symptoms, still don’t have symptoms, I quarantined for them is I touched a gasoline pump handle. That’s literally the only thing that I can think of. I don’t exactly know how, to be completely frank with you, how I got it.
<28:10>
Trying to figure it out. Lots of time. I mean, when it’s all said and done, I’ve had roughly 30 days of quarantine. That’s 30 days without being able to kiss your kids and wife and do those things that you normally do.
<28:22>
Because right at basically a 12 days, I went into the hospital, I spent another five days in the hospital and when I got out of the hospital I asked the physician, “How long does the quarantine last?” And I think the safe and easy answer was 14 days. Now, I’ll tell you, I went to Creighton Hospital, Rochester, Michigan. They were fantastic. The physicians, especially the nurses, like God bless the nurses in everything they do. My sister Diane is one of them. They were fantastic. They were absolutely fantastic. And for a place where the one thing I think we’ve all kind of touched upon is, look, when you’re in the hospital, when you’re in that position, quite honestly, it’s lonely. I don’t know if that sounds weak or what, but you’re by yourself. Right?
<29:12>
Not allowed. Not allowed. Right? And so when those nurses come in and see you and not allowed, not allowed, right. So when the nurses come in and check your vitals every three to four hours, it’s like, “All right, I’ve got somebody to talk to.” Right? So especially when you start to feel better.
<29:30>
Yeah. So I went through that process … Well, technically, just so I back up, if I may just for a bit. So I got in, thought there’s no way. Okay. I should check my temperature. I don’t feel right, but I thought to myself, “There’s no way.” In fact, I made the joke to my wife Michelle that I think I’ve got coronavirus. I’m just totally kidding. I took, my temperature, it was like, 102.6 so I did like any guy, or at least my buddies would do, I said, “I’ll go watch a movie and see if it kind of backs off.”
<29:58>
Well, it didn’t. So I went through the drive through for screening and basically I was sent home and said, well go quarantine for 14 days and see, you’ll get through this. Chances are you probably have it. So the athlete in me, I will tell you this, the athlete in me, that’s the tough guy that just pushes, right? Grinding and just getting things done. It kind of worked against me here because truthfully if I could have recognized, Hey, stop trying to beat this thing when it’s only getting worse, I probably would have went to the hospital sooner.
<30:32>
I do not … And I was very aware of not overwhelming hospitals, but my points here for bringing that up is I probably would have also got out of the hospital much quicker. So instead of a five day stay, possibly been a two or three day stays, specially if they would have prescribed HCQ, that would have been fantastic.
<30:52>
I did.
<30:56>
I would say within 12 hours are you saw improvement and when I went into the hospital I was-
<31:03>
Yeah. My pulse ox was 86, so I did not get put on a ventilator or something like that. Certainly I was provided oxygen support. Went on the Z-Pak-
<31:18>
Zinc as well. Yes. I mean, it’s all through the IV drip, right?
<31:22>
So you’re just sitting there hanging out. But that period of driving to the hospital, my wife’s driving me and just seeing her concern, I mean, that’s part of it, right? You see how much they’re concerned. I’d much rather me have it than her have it or the kids.
<31:39>
She never got it or the kids.
<31:43>
I went in the backseat <crosstalk 00:31:44] style though.
<31:46>
There’s no doubt that she’s tougher than me. Right? There’s no doubt about it.
<31:55>
Yeah. I’ll tell you probably about 95%. the only thing is my lung capacity isn’t quite where it was.
<32:04>
Correct.
<32:06>
Yes, absolutely.
<32:09>
I had some pneumonia, I think, showing up or I should say, what is it? Brown glass appearance. Yes.
<32:21>
Well, that’s why I’m like, “Hey, prescribe whenever you’ve got to prescribe, let me get out of here.”
<32:30>
I asked them about it, and I didn’t know what was called at the time, I just said, “The malaria drug.” And they said, “Okay.” And they ran through some different thoughts about it-
<32:42>
They had it. They sure did.
<32:55>
Absolutely. So actually my business partner, Troy Evans, he’s the one who sent me a text and said, “Hey, ask if you can get that.”
<33:03>
Yeah. So-
