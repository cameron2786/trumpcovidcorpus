Here. Mr. President, thank you. We’re a little bit different kind of financial institution that is <inaudible 00:18:10> bank. We can do a lot to try to help. We are and will. Yesterday, we announced two grants totally $210 million for small business. One of them aligned with our longterm focus on women’s economic empowerment and economic development, and a second to help with short- term needs that have been caused by the spread of the COBID-19. We’re doing all kinds of other things. We’ve frozen our system at a time where we typically don’t because we want to make sure that it’s stable and resilient and secure at this important time in the US. We are working to make sure that we can help distribute funds to small business owners as quickly as possible. Today, we distributed $2 billion in realtime immediately to small businesses. We want to work on growing that capability. We’re waiving monthly fees for the next few months for people who need to get online, small businesses that want to create an e-commerce gateway. We have a back to business platform, which we use during natural disasters where we provide an online directory informing Americans what businesses are open, and we’re going to expand that as this economy opens back up after we get past the build up of the COVID-19. We also believe, Mr. President, we play a very big role in the actual recovery. I have a team that’s working on business process and marketing class to help small businesses, and for that matter, the travel industry, which brings many, many people here to America and brings our citizens to the cities and other countries around the world. Again, thank you for all you’re doing. I want to thank the Secretary, who has done a terrific job. Larry, Ivanka, who’s done a great job on this, as well as the workforce board that I sat, I had the privilege of sitting on with her, and then who administers grants as well, for all you’re doing.
