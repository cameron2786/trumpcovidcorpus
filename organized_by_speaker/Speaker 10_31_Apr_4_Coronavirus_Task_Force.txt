Mr. President, you just said that you want to see us few lives lost as possible in this pandemic. But there are still eight governors, all Republicans, who have refused to issue these statewide stay at home orders. Your own experts, including Dr. Fauci, have said stay at home orders are the most effective way to stop the spread of this virus. So why not do everything possible <crosstalk 00:39:57> right now to do that?

South Carolina has 1700 cases right now of coronavirus. Utah has 1,255. Are these not States that you think should have the stay at home order?

It’s larger than some states that do have stay at home orders.

Isn’t the key to this pandemic getting ahead of those numbers though?
