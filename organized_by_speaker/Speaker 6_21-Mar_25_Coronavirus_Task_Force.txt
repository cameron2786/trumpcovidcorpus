Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for you. One is this, that tomorrow you’re going to be speaking with the G20 leaders, and I want to know if you’re going to lead an effort to craft a worldwide ban on wild animal markets, so as to prevent another pandemic, given that COVID-19 is a zoonotic that was transferred to humans in trade of exotic animals?

And to follow up, also Dr. Ashish Jha, who is the head of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, says that the key to getting this economy open as soon as possible is to test everyone who needs testing so we can quarantine all infected individuals and allow everyone else to go back to work immediately. Would you subscribe to that strategy?

And if not, how many deaths are acceptable?

But the States aren’t siloed. And so if you test one state and then the person moves over to the other state, well then.
