Mr. President, you had called on me.
<01:04:22>
I appreciate it. Since you shared with us something else that you saw on TV today, I have a question about something you said on Thursday, which is that you were angry because information about the virus should have been told to us earlier and a lot sooner. People knew it was happening, and people did not want to talk about it. Many Americans are saying the exact same thing about you, that you should’ve warned them the virus was spreading like wildfire through the month of February instead of holding rallies with thousands of people. Why did you wait so long-
<01:04:55>
To warn them?
<01:04:57>
And why did you not have social distancing until March 16th.
<01:05:02>
I’m we Weijia Jiang with CBS News.
<01:05:13>
Chinese nationals, but by the way, not Americans who are also coming from China.
<01:05:51>
You’re the president. You should’ve warned people-
<01:05:55>
That it was spreading so quickly.
<01:05:56>
And by the way, when you issued the ban, the virus was already here.
<01:06:08>
There was-
<01:06:14>
But you know it was going to spread and become a pandemic?
<01:06:16>
I did my research. On the 23rd of March you said you knew this was going to be a pandemic-
<01:06:22>
Well before-
<01:06:25>
So you knew it was going to spread?
<01:06:34>
So do you acknowledge that you didn’t think it was going to spread?
<01:06:37>
Did you not know it was going to spread?
<01:06:47>
And that’s a fair point.
