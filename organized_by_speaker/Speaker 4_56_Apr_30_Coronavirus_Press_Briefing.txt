On unemployment, there are many businesses who are concerned that as America opens back up again because of a provision in the CARES Act that gives an additional $600, they won’t be able to get their employees back because they make more money staying at home than they would if they came back to work, which has caused some governors to suggest that they might strip those people of their unemployment insurance if they refuse to go back to work. Is that something you would support?
