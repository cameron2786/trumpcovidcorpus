Just a quick one to Dr. Birx, please. I asked you, I think it was about eight or nine days, about the data from all these tests, and you had suggested that there would soon be a website where we would see all the data. Are we closer to that? When do you expect that? Do you have any data to give us tonight? As far as I can tell, this has not been publicly released yet.

Dr. Fauci … <inaudible 01:33:55> Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, whomever, I guess what is the testing standard here? Are you going to need to test people who are well or only people who are symptomatic? Obviously, let’s say in Omaha, ten people walk into a hospital. Five come in. They’re all tested positive. Five go home. They may still be positive. What is your standard in order to make these recommendations?

I’d like to put it to Dr. Fauci, if I could. Dr. Fauci, Sunday will mark one month since the first death from this new disease. I wanted to ask you a bit of a philosophical question. I’ve known you for 25 years. You’ve been through HIV/AIDS, MERS, SARS, West Nile virus, Ebola, all of that. How has this nation changed since that first death one month ago?
