Mr President, this is a question for the vice president. On March 9th, you said one million tests had been delivered and another four million would be delivered by the end of the week. That clearly did not happen. What happened with those projections? What went wrong?
<01:24:16>
You’re saying four million tests were delivered by the end of that week?
<01:26:26>
Mr. President, just a follow up on something you said before. Are you considering a temporary ban on all domestic flights?
<01:26:59>
What about rail travel?
<01:28:47>
What about you or me? What about public? Should we be wearing masks out? We’ve heard lots of different recommendations.
<01:29:40>
Mr. President.
<01:29:41>
Thank you Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about social distancing and how it applies to religious organizations. Some churches, as you know, have continued to hold services even though you have advised people that they need to practice social distancing. There was a pastor of a mega church in Florida over the weekend who held services that were attended by several hundred people. So my question to you is, should pastors be holding services in the middle of this pandemic? Even if they do, should Americans be going to churches?
<01:31:27>
But you have talked about the failings of the Obama Administration and leaving you with empty shelves and no plans. <crosstalk 00:01:31:33>.
<01:31:37>
They got rid of the pandemic office and the national security council.
<01:31:42>
Oh, no, no, no, no.
<01:31:44>
I’m pointing out what they have said and what you have said. That’s all.
<01:31:50>
Mr. President <crosstalk 01:31:51>
<01:33:43>
Mr. President, Seattle police have reported a surge in calls about domestic violence. A number of groups have raised concern.
<01:33:51>
Domestic violence. A number of groups have raised concerns that the longer people are stuck at home, the more domestic violence cases there are going to be. Do you share those concerns and what is being done to control <crosstalk 01:34:03>.
<01:37:30>
Could you say how many have been released?
<01:39:55>
In less than 24 hours sir, two whips will arrive at Port Everglades with people who are infected with Coronavirus.
<01:40:47>
So they will be let into the country?
<01:41:22>
<crosstalk 01:41:22> before being sent on.
<01:41:37>
At the risk of you getting chewed out again.
<01:41:41>
Mr. President, the IRS is requiring people who don’t normally file income tax to file a simple income tax return in order to get their $1,200 check. Is that the way it’s going to be? Or is there something you can do to <crosstalk 01:41:55>.
<01:43:12>
Thank you Mr. President.
