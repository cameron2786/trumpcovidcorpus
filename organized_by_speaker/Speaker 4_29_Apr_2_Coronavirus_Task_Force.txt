Mr. Secretary, on a separate subject. Have you been in touch with Leader McConnell and Speaker Pelosi about their differences right now about another stimulus package?

Mr. Secretary, just more broadly perhaps for the administrator if not for you as well. Some small businesses, restaurant owners for example are finding that laying off their employees so that they can start collecting unemployment is better both for them as business owners and for their workers. What incentives do they have right now to keep their employees on the payroll if no one’s coming into their restaurant?
