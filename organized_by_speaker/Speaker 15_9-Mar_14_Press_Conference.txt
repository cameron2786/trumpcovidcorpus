You said tomorrow you’re speaking to all of the Governors, are we?
<01:03:38>
Oh Monday, I’m sorry.
<01:03:39>
So you are going to speak to all of the Governors. Are we looking at any sort of domestic travel restrictions that could be coming down the pipeline anytime soon? And my other question for you is Leader McConnell’s statement saying that he was going to read the bill, that he was going to speak to some of his members over the weekend. Are you confident that the Senate is going to take up this house legislation and get it done quickly?
