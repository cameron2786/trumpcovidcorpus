Thank you Mr president and thanks to the team for getting this great operation up and running for the benefit of the country. I’m Heyward Donagen with Rite Aid and we are currently operating 40% of the current test sites in 25 locations across eight States. I had the opportunity as I was driving up to stop at our Richmond location and see the testing in action and thank the associates, whether it be security or pharmacy, front end, everybody who’s helping with this great effort and all of the customers that appreciate this so much. It was really amazing to see and I want to thank my 50,000 associates also for keeping these retail locations up and running during these really, really tough times. It’s been quite amazing and we too are going to expand our testing and we’re doing about 1500 a day. Thanks
