Say one thing, as you and the first lady were out there honoring what transpired 75 years ago, that we had to end the tyranny of what Hitler was doing throughout Europe. We now battle something that is like a war, that this is a virus that came from a distant land that we did not invite. But just as we had to transform our country then and unite, that leadership you’re providing is doing just that. As you talk about ventilators, gearing up, testing, more than 1.7 million in one week. The ingenuity of this country will solve this problem and we will not just solve and get a vaccine for us, but for the rest of the world. I do want to thank you, and coming from California, I know I’m have a blue state. I know I have a governor, but the way you’ve worked together, watching you send those Navy ships to New York and to California, build those hospitals in a time of need, I do want to thank you on behalf of everyone in California for the work you’ve done.
