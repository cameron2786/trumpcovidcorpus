Secretary Pompeo, on the issue of disinformation. Is there any particular locusts for this disinformation or is it diffused?
Sec. Pompeo: <01:01:04>
It’s pretty diffused, unfortunately, but we’ve certainly seen it come from places like China and Russia and Iran where there are coordinated efforts to disparage what America is doing and in our activity to have to do all the things that President Trump has set in motion here.
<01:01:19>
Other than what you’re doing this morning, what are you doing to fight back?
Sec. Pompeo: <01:01:21>
Lot of things. Lots of work. One of the things want to make sure the American people go to trusted sources for the information, but we’ve made clear, we’ve spoken to these countries directly that they need to knock it off, that we don’t approve of it, and then there are a handful of other things we’re engaged in to make sure that the right information is out there and accurate information is given. This idea of transparency and accurate information is very important. It’s how we protect American people from something like this ever happening again.
