Mr. President <crosstalk 01:01:14>.

A quick question on something you just said. You said when someone is President of the United States, their authority is total. That is not true. Who told you that?
<01:27:28>
Has any governor agreed that you have the authority to decide when their states <crosstalk 01:27:32>?
<01:27:34>
That no one is <crosstalk 01:27:34>-
<01:27:36>
But who told you the president has the total authority?
