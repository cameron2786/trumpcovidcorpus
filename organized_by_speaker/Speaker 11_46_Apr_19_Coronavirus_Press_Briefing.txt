<Crosstalk 01:01:52>. Mr. President, thank you very much.

Have we saved everyone? No. But have we lost anyone because we didn’t have a bed or we didn’t have a ventilator or we didn’t have healthcare staff? No. The people we lost are the people we couldn’t save, not for lack of trying and not for lack of doing everything that we could do as a society, not only as a government, and as a healthcare system.
