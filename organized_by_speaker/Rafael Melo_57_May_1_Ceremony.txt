Thank you, Mr. President. Kind of covered it all for us already. So, we are real estate agents in the D.C. area and this mission really came about after receiving a phone call from some of our clients who work in the food and beverage industry here. They gave us some insight on COVID-19, the impact that it had on their business, and from there we just felt compelled to act. So, we started a Go Fund Me campaign to give them some additional business, took money, ordered catering directly from their restaurant, and we dropped it off with different staff working at various hospitals around the area, tirelessly obviously. The campaign started picking up, so we started doing more donations and we kept dropping off. We also increased our goal, but we kept dropping off at different hospitals around the area. So, another really cool factor that we did to sprinkle that to sprinkle in with this was we started compiling videos of some of our contributors expressing their gratitude and those videos were being sent along with the food drop-offs. Let me get you right.
