Do you think there’s a solution to this, other than buying more masks, do healthcare providers need to change how they’re using them?
<51:41>
Mr. President, I just want to read you some of what some of the doctors on the front lines of this crisis are saying. A doctor …
<51:50>
These are doctors who are talking about the shortage of medical supplies that they are facing. Dr. Faize Bucks in Kentucky says, “There’s absolutely no way to protect myself.” A surgeon in Fresno, California says, “We are at war with no ammo.” Dr. Mel in Illinois says, “If this is a wartime situation, then now is the time to act.” I know you’re talking now about increasing production at so many of these facilities to get the masks out. But given that this is one of the wealthiest, most powerful countries in the world, should this even be happening? Shouldn’t this have been resolved weeks ago?
<53:41>
There has been many … Mr. President, it’s been more than three months since your administration learned about this, about this virus.
<53:47>
So, why not sooner?
<55:10>
Are you seeing that happening? Are you seeing those hospitals talking about the <crosstalk 00:55:13>.
<56:35>
There’s a question about the timeline here, and even FEMA can’t quite answer sooner what the timeline is. Days, weeks?
<01:11:20>
Can I follow up on that?
<01:11:21>
Because as you were saying China was extremely secretive about this. Several of your advisors have been critical of China. Secretary Pompeo was talking about it yesterday, and he had been saying so for quite some time. So why then on January 24th did you Tweet that “China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus, that the United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency?”
<01:11:44>
“It will all work out well.” Why were you Tweeting that then?
<01:11:51>
You said they were transparent, right?
<01:11:58>
That was a month after China <crosstalk 01:12:00>.
<01:12:16>
But this was a month after <inaudible 01:12:18>.
