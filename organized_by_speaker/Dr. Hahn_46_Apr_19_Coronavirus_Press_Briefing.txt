I don’t think we have evidence that one would be more susceptible or less. What I think we can say is that the mitigation efforts have really helped with respect to this and that what we’ve seen is the number of cases have gone down. And if we follow the gating criteria for the opening, we’re then able to institute phase one and have appropriate measures in place to actually reduce any chance of flare-up of the cases.
