Thank you very much. I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus. We’ll be invoking the defense production act just in case we need it. In other words, I think you all know what it is and it can do a lot of good things if we need it and we will have it all completed signing it in just a little while. Right after I’m finished with this conference, I’ll be signing it. It’s prepared to go. So we will be invoking the Defense Production Act. Last week I signed an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act, which is we invoked previously and which activated FEMA National Response Coordination Center, FEMA is fully engaged at the highest levels.
<20:16>
Today FEMA is activated in every region. We are at level one, level one being the highest level which we will work with and we’ve been working with FEMA. I’ve done a lot of work with FEMA. They’re incredible. It’s always been on hurricanes or tornadoes. There right now in Tennessee, a large group working in Tennessee have been incredible. It was tragic event Alabama last year, also a tornado and then obviously the numerous hurricanes in different locations that were in some cases very devastating and in every case FEMA came through. This is a very different kind of work for FEMA, but they will come through as they always do.
<21:02>
We have tremendous people, tremendous talent in FEMA. We’re sending upon request the two hospital ships, they’re being prepared right now. They’re massive ships. They’re the big white ships with the red cross on the sides. One is called The Mercy and the other is called The Comfort and they are in tiptop shape. They soon will be. They’re getting ready to come up to New York. I spoke with governor Cuomo about it. He’s excited about it. We haven’t made the final determination as to where it’s going to go on the West coast. The Comfort is located now in San Diego and it’s going to be… We’ll be picking the destination fairly shortly, so those two ships are being prepared to go and they can be launched over the next week or so depending on need.
<21:56>
Earlier this week, the first clinical trial of the vaccine candidate for the virus began in Washington state, as you probably know. The genetic sequence of the virus was first published in January, but thanks to the unprecedented partnership between the FDA, NIH, and the private sector, we’ve reached human trials for the vaccine just eight weeks later. It’s a record by many, many months. It used to take years to do this and now we did it just in a very short while. That’s the fastest development in history of what we’re doing with regard to the vaccine and making very, very big progress.
<22:36>
Today I can announce further steps to expand testing capacity. We’re working with several groups to determine if the self swab a much easier process than the current process. That’s a not very nice to do. I can tell you because I did it. But we have a current process that’s a little bit difficult. If you haven’t done. The groups are working on determining if a self swab by an individual is as effective as the other. The others very effective, very accurate but we’re going to see if we can do a self swab which would be a lot more popular. I can tell you that. So and that would be administered also by a health official but it would be a lot easier to do. The fact is that the health professionals would… It would free up a lot. Let me just say the self swab is what it is. It’s a self swab. You do it yourself.
<23:40>
The other has to be issued by a health professional and it’s something that is quite difficult and we think it’s working out for the self swab. If it would test positive that people would go and they would do what they have to do, but we think that’s probably working out. I’ve asked the FDA to cut through the red tape and reduce regulatory barriers. We are looking at some very exciting things and I’m going to be holding the second news conference either today. We’re going to talk about the FDA. Some things are happening that are quite exciting and we’re going to be doing that either later today or tomorrow, fairly early tomorrow. So we’ll see what happens. But the FDA, my instructions is I’ve been working very, very hard on a number of developments and we’ll be discussing that with you later today or tomorrow.
<24:35>
This afternoon I’ll be meeting with nurses on the front lines of the battle against the virus. They’re truly American heroes. They want to get it done. They’re incredible people. So we’re going to be meeting with nurses and I actually look forward to that. Very brave. They’re taking a lot of risk and they have done an incredible job and they never complain.
<24:59>
Today I’m also announcing that the department of housing and urban development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April. So we’re working very closely with Dr. Ben Carson and everybody from HUD. Every generation of American has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation.
<25:23>
In World War II young people in their teenage years volunteered to fight. They wanted to fight so badly because they love our country. Workers refuse to go home and slept in factory floors to keep assembly lines running. The numbers of ships that they built during World War II to this day has never… Nothing like that has ever been equal. They were doing ships literally on a daily basis. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it and to this day nobody seen anything like that. What they were able to do during World War II and now it’s our time. We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together and we’ll come through together.
<26:03>
We are all in this together and we’ll come through together. It’s the invisible enemy. That’s always the toughest enemy, the invisible enemy, but we are going to defeat the invisible enemy. I think we’re going to do it even faster than we thought and it will be a complete victory. It’ll be a total victory.
<26:19>
So we’ll have a second conference, again having to do with the FDA on this. I think it’s going to be potentially a very exciting news conference and we will do it as quickly as we can, so whether it’s today or tomorrow. And I’ll, with that, ask, Mike Pence to say a few words and thank you very much.
<31:13>
Thank you very much. Dr. Birks, please.
<35:02>
Thank you, Deborah, very much. Mark, please.
<37:39>
Thank you very much, Mark. Seema, please.
<39:46>
Thank you very much.
<39:49>
Robert, please.
<42:15>
Thank you very much, Robert. Thank you. Thank you, all. That’s very nice. Any questions, please?
<42:22>
Go.
Reporter #1: <42:23>
<inaudible 00:42:23> two questions, if I may. Your treasury secretary was on Capitol Hill talking about the potential for what could come and he said that unemployment could skyrocket to 20%. That could rival the Great Depression. Are we looking at potentially historic-
<42:39>
No. Well, I don’t agree with that.
Reporter #1: <42:39>
… devastation?
<42:41>
Yeah. No, I don’t agree. That’s a absolute total worst case scenario. But no, we don’t look at that at all.
Reporter #1: <42:47>
Okay. Thank you. And my second question-
<42:48>
We’re nowhere near it.
Reporter #1: <42:49>
Okay. Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus? There are reports of dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in this country. Your own aid, Secretary Azar says he does not use this term. He says, “Ethnicity does not cause the virus.” Why do you keep using this?
<43:06>
Because it comes from China.
Reporter #1: <43:06>
A lot of people say it’s racist.
<43:08>
It’s not racist at all. No, not at all. It comes from China, that’s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.
Reporter #1: <43:15>
Do you know the concerns about Chinese Americans in this country?
<43:15>
Yeah, please, John.
Reporter #1: <43:16>
To the aids behind you, are you comfortable with this term?
<43:19>
I have great love for all of the people from our country. But as you know, China tried to say at one point, maybe they’ve stopped now, that it was caused by American soldiers. That can’t happen. It’s not going to happen, not as long as I’m president. It comes from China. John, please.
<43:44>
Yes.
<43:53>
Yep.
<43:56>
We do have. We have tremendous numbers of ventilators, but there has never been an instance like this where no matter what you have, it’s not enough. That would be the case. It’s being signed. It’s essentially drawn and I’m going to sign it in just a little while. If we need to use it, we’ll be using it at full speed ahead.
<44:19>
Well, we’re going to know whether or not urgent, but we will… Yeah, we do have targets. We have targets for certain pieces of equipment. We have targets for masks, you know, the masks, the numbers of masks are incredible. We’ve ordered millions of them, but we need millions more. A thing like this has never been requested. We’ve never had to even think in terms of these numbers, but we need millions of masks and all of that will be ordered. We need respirators. We need, ventilators is a big thing because it’s a complex piece of equipment. So we have a lot of ventilators, but we’re going to be ordering more.
<44:55>
To be determined. We’re working with the Senate right now. We’re working with everybody on Capitol Hill. There has been tremendous… There really has been. I mean, with some exceptions obviously because it’s always the way it is. They have been getting along very well, Republicans and Democrats. It’s a nice thing, very bipartisan, and so forth.
<45:15>
Well, we’re going to see. I don’t want to get into that right now, John. We are looking at different numbers. We’re looking at timing. That would be different, splitting the time, splitting the payments. We’re looking at a lot of different things. It hasn’t been determined yet, but it will shortly be determined and people want to go big as opposed… Everybody seems to want to go big and they want to get to the recovery. The big thing we can do is get rid of this horrible, I call it the unseen, the unseen enemy, you call it. There is a thousand different terms for it. It snuck up on us. It did 128 countries, I think. It’s in something like that, very close to that. Think of that, so it spreads violently. It’s a very contagious, very, very contagious virus.
<46:04>
I do. I actually do. I’m looking at it that way because, you know, if it got out of control. The big thing we did was a very early stoppage of people coming in who could be very, very heavily infected. It was a very good move and it was very early, very, very early when most people, including a lot of professionals, they didn’t want us to do it. That really saved a lot of lives. And yeah, I look at it. I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president. I mean, that’s what we’re fighting. It’s a very tough situation. You have to do things. You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they’ve ever been. We had the best economy we’ve ever had. And then one day, you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy. But, we’re doing it and we’re doing it well. And I’ll tell you, the American people have been incredible, for the most part, they’ve been really incredible. Yeah, please, <Kaitlin 00:20:57>.
<47:00>
Sure.
<47:13>
Well, you know, hospitals are supposed to have ventilators too. And when we have thousands of ventilators, it sounds like a lot, but this is a very unforeseen thing. Nobody ever thought of these numbers. Nobody ever saw numbers like this, even with regard to testing. Normally, we wouldn’t be doing testing and they decided to do it, very, very hard to ramp up. Now, we’re getting highly sophisticated tests and it’s going very well. But, nobody has ever heard of testing in the kind of quantities that you’re talking about.
<47:42>
Well, we knew. It depends. It depends on how it goes. Worst case, absolutely, a best case, not at all, so we’re going to have to see where it goes. But we are ordering thousands and thousands of ventilators and they’re complex. You know, these are complex machines. But, we’re ordering them. Does anybody have a, Mike maybe you do, how many do we have?
<48:07>
Please. Yeah, please. Do you know the number?
<49:14>
We can give you that exact number. We’ll give it to you.
<49:14>
But we’re ordering a lot more.
<49:15>
Yeah, go ahead in the back, yes.
<49:20>
Yeah, one second. One second, Kaitlin. We’ll do it in a second.
<49:23>
You’ll be able to do it.
<49:25>
Yes.
Reporter #2: <49:25>
The first one on the Canadian border, what was the tipping point? Friday, we talked about it. Then Monday you said, no one knew. We’re not considering closing the border.
<49:32>
No, I said not yet. I spoke with the prime minister, Trudeau, a very good relationship obviously between us and our two countries and no tipping point. It’s just that we want to isolate from the standpoint we don’t want people coming into contact because that’s the way we’re going to win this war. That is so important and we both thought it was time.
<49:53>
Now it’s not affecting trade. It’s non-essential. It’s non-essential crossings. It won’t affect trade at all. And it was just something we thought would be good for both countries. Yes, please. <crosstalk 00:24:04>.
Reporter #2: <50:06>
The second question, Mr. President. How can you be sure that trade-
<50:08>
Go ahead, please.
Reporter #2: <50:09>
… is not going to be a factor of the virus? How can you be sure that trade and everything that’s being shipped from one side, <crosstalk 00:50:14>?
<50:15>
Well, they’re doing it in a very careful manner. You can only be vigilant and very professional. It’s not pertaining at this moment to trade between the two countries.
Reporter #2: <50:26>
Thank you, sir.
<50:27>
Yeah, please.
Reporter #3: <50:27>
We are hearing that the trillion dollar economic stimulus package could look something like $50 billion for the airlines, $150 billion dollars in loan guarantees for critical sectors in the economy, a $250 billion dollar payment on April 6th directly to individuals, another $250 billion dollar payment on May 18th, again, directly to individuals and as well $300 billion dollars for small business loan guarantees. Is that, in the general sense, of what you’re looking at?
<50:53>
It could be. It could be. And we’re also playing with a lot of numbers, a lot of very big numbers and a lot of very small numbers, frankly. We want to take care, we have to help everybody. It was nobody’s fault this happened. I mean, some people could say it was somebody’s fault actually, but it was nobody’s fault. And certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers in planes and had no passengers on cruise ships and all of the things that have happened. But I will say that, they can’t be blamed for this. And we want to keep those companies vibrant because it’s, there is going to be a comeback very, very quickly as soon as this is solved. And it will be solved. We will win. And there will be a comeback and it’ll take place very quickly.
Reporter #3: <51:36>
<inaudible 00:51:36> $50 billion dollars. There is, give or take, 330 million Americans or, so if you just do the math on that, that’s about $750 a person, a family of four, that would be about $3,000 on average, again, rough, rough map, which is that where this is headed? It’s actually thousands of dollars.
<51:52>
Well, I don’t want to say that because it’s a moving… Every number that you mentioned, yes, we’ve talked about those numbers. We’re also moving those numbers in both directions, so we’ll let you know. It’s moving along fast.
<52:03>
What directions, so we’ll let you know. It’s moving along fast. Again, there’s a great bipartisan effort going on that I haven’t really seen before to this extent.
<52:18>
No. They’re looking at it. It’s down the line, and they’re looking at it very seriously. And I think it would be a great thing, because the others, to use a nice word, it’s very inconvenient. It’s very tough.
<52:42>
Well, I think we’re doing a really good job. We started off with a termination of the border, the people coming in from China where this all started. That meant I took it very seriously. And when I use the word calm, calm doesn’t mean that I’m not taking it seriously, and we should be calm. We should be extremely calm. But yeah, 95% within the Republican party and over 50%, and, also, we have very great approval numbers. People like the job that we’re doing. And when you compare this to other epidemics, or if you want to use a different term, you can, but within this country, and you look at what’s happened over the years, this is being handled very, very professionally.
<53:24>
We have the greatest professionals in the world. We’re doing a good job. Nobody’s ever been swamped like this, and nothing’s been so contagious. The level of contagion has been incredible, actually. Nobody’s seen anything quite like this.
<53:37>
Yeah, Peter, go ahead.
<54:01>
I’ll let Mike answer that.
<56:16>
You’d have to ask them that question. No, I wouldn’t say so, but perhaps that’s been the story of life. That does happen on occasion, and I’ve noticed where some people have been tested fairly quickly. Look, we inherited a very-
<56:34>
Excuse me, excuse me. We inherited a very obsolete system. This was a system that was out of date, obsolete, or it was a system that was never meant to take care of the kind of quantity, the number of people that we’re talking about. Millions and millions of people. If you go back in years past, like even recently with the flu, nobody had tests before. They didn’t test the entire nation to see whether or not they had flu. They got the flu, they got better. Hopefully they got better. That was it. Now all of a sudden, they do this very complex testing.
<57:05>
What we’ve done is we broke it down. We broken up the system, but it was obsolete and/or you could say it was also a system that just wasn’t meant to handle the kind of volume that you’re talking about. We’ve rebuilt it into a system that, for the future, will be a very good system if you want to go this route. But this was never done before, and I would imagine it will be done in the future, but we built it into a very good system by using private companies, the great private companies. And I have to say Roche has been doing a very good job. They’re doing a lot of work, a very good job.
<57:36>
But this was an obsolete system. This was not a system that was meant to do anything like this or even near this.
<57:42>
John?
<57:53>
Who heads that group? Those countries do, probably. Go check.
<57:58>
I know, I’m sure of free trade… Look, China’s paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there’s no reason to do that. They haven’t even spoken to me about that. China hasn’t asked me to do that, but we’re getting billions of dollars a year from tariffs from China, and I can’t imagine Americans asking for that. But it could be that China will ask for a suspension or something. We’ll see what happens. China’s having a very rough time. They have their worst year in 76 years as I understand it. They’re having a very, very tough time. And then on top of it, this happened with the virus.
<58:31>
But no, we’re taking in billions of dollars a year in tariffs. And this was caused by something totally unrelated to tariffs.
<58:51>
The answer is yes.
<58:53>
Very soon. Probably today, yes.
<59:06>
Well, I think essential is medical. We have military working together. We have industry working together. And again, it’s not affecting trade. So things like that, but just leisurely, let’s go to a restaurant and have dinner, which a lot of people do. They come both ways. They go in both directions, that kind of thing, we have ended on a temporary basis. Yeah, please go ahead.
<59:29>
Not close it. No, we’re not going to close it, but we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us great latitude as to what we do.
<59:38>
Please.
<59:40>
Yeah, go ahead. You know what? Go ahead. Sure.
<59:41>
Doctor.
<01:02:10>
Go ahead.
<01:02:29>
No, I haven’t seen the article. We are making a lot of progress therapeutically. I will say that, but I have not seen that article, no.
<01:02:36>
Go ahead.
<01:03:02>
There were certain industries that people know. The airlines would be number one if you look at what’s going on. They go from having the best year they’ve ever had to having no passengers because of what we’ve had to do in order to win this war. It’s a war, and so basically, you know what many of the industries are. What we want to do is we want to make sure they all stay together so that after the war is won, we can immediately go right back up to where we were and even beyond. I think we’re going to go beyond where we were, and a lot of people are saying that by the way. We’re poised to do that, but we have to win the war first.
<01:03:34>
Yeah, please go ahead.
<01:03:52>
We’re talking about all of it. Haven’t detailed it yet. We have detailed it to senators and to members of the House. We have been talking about it, and we’re coming up with numbers. Haven’t gotten there yet, but certainly hotel industry, the cruise ship industry, the airlines. Those are all prime candidates. Absolutely.
<01:04:13>
Which border?
<01:04:20>
I would say 30 days, and hopefully at the end of 30 days, we’ll be in great shape.
<01:04:25>
Jeff, please.
<01:04:54>
Well, I think my earlier comments are to be calm. I do want people to be calm, because we’re going to win this. And we’re going to win it, it’s just a question of time ,and I want it to go quickly. So based on the fact that I want it to go quickly, I hope they just listened to what we’ve been saying over the last period of time. We don’t want them gathering. And I see they do gather, including on beaches and including in restaurants, young people. They don’t realize. They are feeling invincible. I don’t know if you felt invincible when you were very young, but they were feeling totally invincible, or are feeling that way, but they don’t realize that they can be carrying lots of bad things home to grandmother and grandfather and even their parents. So we want them to heed the advice. We made the advice, and I think it’s getting through. I do believe it’s getting through.
<01:05:39>
Jim, please.
<01:05:41>
If they’re what?
<01:05:45>
Well I think I just said it.
<01:05:48>
Heed the advice. I just said. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Peter.
<01:06:06>
Not think. No, no, I don’t think, I know where it came from. I don’t know if you’d say China’s to blame. Certainly, we didn’t get an early run on it. It would have been helpful if we knew about it earlier, but it comes from China, and it’s not a question about that. Nobody’s questioning that.
<01:06:32>
Well, I have a lot of respect for Tom Cotton, and I know exactly what he’s been saying. And there are those people that say that. So we’ll see what happens. Thank you.
<01:06:41>
<crosstalk 00:14:41>.
<01:06:41>
It’s your turn. Go ahead.
<01:06:43>
<crosstalk 00:14:45>.
<01:06:43>
Please. He’s been waiting a long time, please. You’ve had your hand up so nicely for a long. It’s your time.
<01:07:05>
Yeah, I’m not happy to see it. I have my own disputes with all three of those media groups. I think you know that very well, but I don’t like seeing that at all. I’m not happy about that at all.
<01:07:19>
Yes, please.
<01:07:25>
No, I don’t believe they’re inflicting. I think they could have given us a lot earlier notice, absolutely. Please.
<01:07:39>
Who are you asking of that question, because I see that they’re very high. If you look, I’m 95% of the Republican party. We just had a poll that was done by a very reputable group. We’re beating sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida, the state of Florida, and in other states. So I don’t really know who you’re talking about.
<01:08:02>
Jennifer, go ahead, please. Please.
<01:08:12>
I did, and they explained to me where they’re coming from. They went from, as I said, full planes packed, the best year they’ve ever had by far to, boom, one day empty because of what we have to do to win this war, or we would have a level of death like people haven’t seen before. So they’ve been fantastic. They’ve been great, but they went from being extremely happy to being people that are running companies that are going to need some help, and we’ll help them, Jennifer.
<01:08:53>
It’s going. There’s a lot of influx to those loans, as you could imagine. A lot of people are looking at it, but we’re going to be increasing funding a lot, and they’re very well prepared to do what they have to do. And the SBA is doing a fantastic job. She is doing a really good job, the administrator.
<01:09:08>
John?
<01:11:19>
<Katelyn 00:01:11:22>, go ahead.
<01:12:45>
Go ahead in the back, please.
<01:14:25>
Go ahead, please.
<01:14:37>
No, we’re not seeing that at all.
<01:14:54>
I wonder who said that. You know who said that?
<01:15:00>
Say the term again.
<01:15:15>
No. No, no. I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There’s nothing not to agree.
<01:15:22>
How about last question, please? Please, go ahead.
<01:15:48>
My message is to all Americans, but to those Americans who are going through a lot, we love them. We’re with them and we will not let them down. Thank you all very much.
