Mr. President, you tweeted earlier, linking the closing of the country to your election success in November. Is this Easter timeline based on your political interests?
<25:19>
You tweeted. You said that the media wants the country to remain closed to hurt your odds of being reelected.
<25:28>
Sir, lawmakers and economists on both sides of the aisle have said that reopening the country by Easter is not a good idea. What is that plan based on?
<25:58>
Your own medical expert does not endorse that plan.

Mr. Vice President, on ventilators, some really important reporting from the Center of Public Integrity today, they suggested that there’s only 16,000 in the national stockpile. Can you just give us some clarity? How many ventilators do you have in the national stockpile? Who else is making them and how long will it take for them to make a critical mass? Because based on the Center for Public Integrity, it appears there aren’t enough if you live or you die as a result.

Dr. Birx, a lot of folks out there, well intentioned, are sewing cloth masks and donating them to hospitals. Can you or Dr. Fauci, can you weigh in on that because obviously these people have great intentions, but there’s some mixed feedback on whether that’s a good idea, better than nothing?
<01:05:58>
For the surgical masks. People are sewing them, so clothing manufacturers, volunteers dropping them off at hospitals, is that necessary? Is that helpful? Is it something you’d recommend?
