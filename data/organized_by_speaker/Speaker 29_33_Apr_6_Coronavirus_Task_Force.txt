Thank you. And this is for the vice president, for Dr. Birx And Dr. Fauci, but can you give us a sense of, and I know you don’t want to make any projections, but where we are with the numbers, because we saw that horrible number today, more than 10,000 deaths now in the US. Are we on track for the those best case scenario numbers that you had laid out, the 100,000 or are we potentially coming in lower than that at this point given some of what you’re seeing?
