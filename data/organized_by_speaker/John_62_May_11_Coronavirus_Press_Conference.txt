You can’t hear me. We had a situation here at the White House on Friday where a member of the Vice President’s staff tested positive for coronavirus, which has now caused three of the top U.S. officials involved in the coronavirus response to self isolate. Two-part question. Where did the system break down to allow that to happen? And what would you say to employers who look at the experience here at the White House and say, “Are we ready for this?”
<24:17>
What do you say, Mr. President, to other companies who may look at this and say, “I don’t know if we’re ready for all this”?
<25:08>
If I can follow up on that, your staff, your senior staff, as you just referenced, is able to get tested every day. When will it be that Americans across the country will be able to get tested every day as they go back to work?
<26:38>
But should people be told to go back to work until they have that assurance that they and their coworkers are able to get a test, which we’re still not there?
<29:25>
If I could follow up, sir. The South China Morning Post, the Beijing newspaper, says that China would like to reopen negotiations on the trade deal to make the terms more favorable to them. Is this something you’d be interested in doing?

Mr. President, up until now, it’s thought that the most vulnerable people were those above the age of 60, or 70, or 80, and the children were pretty much, I don’t want to say immune from this, but weren’t affected by it. But all day long in the news today, we have been hearing and seeing this terrible syndrome…
<37:05>
… that some 85 children have now. Three of them have died. What is the task force talking about in terms of that, and what could be done about it?
<38:53>
Mr. President, with this newly emerging syndrome now among young children, what do you say to parents who would like to get their children back to school, but are now looking at this and potentially afraid to do that?
