Thank you Mr. President. And of course you know, a Harvard junkie and total Harvard man, you just can’t tell them much, right? So anyway, on a serious note, let me just give you a little idea of the Defense Production Act and why it is so important. We are engaged in the most significant industrial mobilization since World War II. We have a wartime president fighting an invisible enemy and we have the full force of government coupled with the full power of private enterprise bearing down on this problem for the American people. What we had to do today with president Trump’s order with respect to General Motors. I want to give you a little background on that. We need industrial mobilization to make adequate ventilators, particularly in the very short run to help the people in New York, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, all around this country as this virus bears down. And the ventilators really are the most important thing for patients who become most seriously ill.

They are literally the lifeline for people. And I personally have been working with FEMA and I’ve been working with HHS and over 10 ventilator companies, making sure we can get what we need as quickly as possible. And virtually every one of those companies has been cooperative, patriotic, moving in Trump time, which is to say as soon as possible, sir. But we did have a problem with GM and Ventech. On the one hand, we had Ford and GE moving forward on a similar kind of project, patriotically moving as fast as possible. Over the last several days, we ran into roadblocks with GM. We cannot afford to lose a single day, particularly over the next 30 to 60 days. So President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act as a way of enhancing and accelerating his mobilization. I salute him for doing so. It’s going to make my job so much easier. For the most part, we’ve had tremendous cooperation from the private sector. Today, sir, was the right day to do it. Thank you, sir.
