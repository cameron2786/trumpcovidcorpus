Question for Dr. Hahn of the FDA. You mentioned the plasma, sir. So these are the plasma that people that were infected that have now either recovered or they’re doing well enough and then they’re transferring it to, is it family members? Can you walk us through? That’s working? Is it kind of like a case by case basis or hospitals? What are the results from that? I just was not familiar with that.

So are people going to be donating plasma enough to meet. Obviously, some of us don’t know if we had it or in recovery. What should people be doing?

Thank you, sir.
