Mr. President, again, I’m looking at the cases around the world in Latin America and the Middle East, and still you don’t want to impose a travel ban for these areas. In Brazil, for instance, the President Bolsanar, he keeps on being very active with groups. Aren’t you afraid that what we’re doing here can be threatening-

Not here, but in the United States.
<01:56:28>
I understand-
<01:56:33>
But the travel ban, I mean, aren’t you-
