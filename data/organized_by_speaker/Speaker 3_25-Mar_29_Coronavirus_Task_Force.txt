Thank you mister president. Let me first start by thanking the administration for all the support that you’ve provided to the industry. One of the things we did, we did hear the challenge and starting in January we’ve ramped up our production in the Americas, including our facility in North Carolina where we are now manufacturing an additional 40 to 50 million masks per month to get into the US healthcare system. And we talked a little about this in the pre-meeting. One of the issues we’re struggling with is the demand increase. I used an anecdotal example of one hospital in New York that traditionally uses roughly 10 to 20,000 masks a week, are now using two to 300,000 mass a week. So you multiply that times the entire US, let alone the same demand outside of the US, that’s part of the issue we’re running into, is even with a significant ramp up in supply, there’s still that demand that is much greater than that supply.
