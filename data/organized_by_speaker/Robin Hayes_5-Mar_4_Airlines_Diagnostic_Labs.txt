Mr. President, Robin Hayes, JetBlue. Thank you very much for having us today, Mr. Vice President. A lot of it’s been said, but we’re taking many of the same measures as everyone else to keep our customers and our crew members, our employees safe and secure. Thank you for putting the vice president in charge of these efforts. The federal government has a tremendous capability when it comes together and is orchestrated with a common goal, and I’d just like to send just a quick shout out to the people in the federal government and the people that work for all of us who are really in the front lines of this and the heroic efforts they’re making every day to keep us safe and secure.
