Thank you Mr. President, I wanted to ask, are you now, or are you considering separating some more with Vice President Pence as a precautionary measure?

Admiral Giroir, if I could. The President just said that Dr. Fauci, Dr. Hahn have tested negative. Then why do they need to be isolated? Is there some concern that they could be spreading the virus in some way? Is there a concern about the testing? Why do they need to isolate?
