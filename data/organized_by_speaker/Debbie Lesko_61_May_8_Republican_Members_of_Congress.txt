Well, I want to say thank you again, President Trump for coming to Arizona. And it was such an honor to be on Air Force One with you. It was my first time so it was awesome. But I want you to know that I believe you are exactly the right person for the job. Despite all of the Democrats, the top Obama people, maybe President Obama himself since we found out yesterday, trying to take you out. Despite all of that, you led our nation into the greatest economy in the world, and I am totally convinced that you will do it again. And so please don’t let all the critics get you down. I know a lot of people are just Trump haters and they say mean things, but there are so many people out there, so many people in Arizona, throughout the nation that absolutely think you’re doing a great job. So please keep it up. We appreciate you.
