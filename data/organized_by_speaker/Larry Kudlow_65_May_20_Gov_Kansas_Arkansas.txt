The Congressional Budget Office has just redone its estimates. After a predictably rough pandemic contraction in the second quarter, they’re looking for a twenty-one and a half percent growth rate, Sir, in the third quarter.

Which would actually, if it can true, would be the biggest growth quarter in American history, or since the data were compiled.

In the fourth quarter over 10%, and actually they’re showing 2021 now at 4.2%. So they’ve lifted their estimates. That would be a wonderful thing, really would.

Yep.
