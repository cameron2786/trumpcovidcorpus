First of all, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, the entire administration and all the agencies, thank you for your strong leadership during this time of crisis. It is noticed and it’s making a difference.

Second of all, I’d like to say a big thank you to all the healthcare workers out there. You’re putting yourself in harms way every day and we really respect what you’re doing and we couldn’t be thankful enough for it and I can tell you that more helps on the way. We as Honeywell, we’re an industrial technology company and one of the businesses that we’re in, protecting industrial worker. But what we’re doing today is we’re repurposing a lot of that equipment to serve the healthcare worker.

A few days ago we announced the start-up of a new manufacturing facility in Rhode Island. We’re going to be hiring 500 employees. We have already 200 onboard and we’re going to be starting the production N95 masks within the next two weeks.

Furthermore, today we’re announcing the start up of another manufacturing facility in Arizona. We’re going to be hiring another 500 people and we’re going to be starting up production in that facility by the middle of May. So in total, we’ve doubled our production of N95 masks already. It’s going to double again within the next 60 days and then within the next 90 days, we’re one of the 5X the capacity we do today. Furthermore, we’re going to be providing other safety equipment to support all the efforts going on. Lastly, I would say a big thing, key to all the Honeywell employees and also announce a $10 million fund for them for all the hourly and administrative employees are having a hard time during this time of crisis. Thank you, Mr. President.
