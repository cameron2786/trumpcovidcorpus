Sir, what do you say to Americans who are upset with you over the way you downplayed this crisis over the last couple of months?
<48:45>
We have it very much under control in this country. The Coronavirus is very much under control, in the USA. It’s going to disappear. It’s like a miracle. It will disappear. March 4th, we have a very small number of people in this country infected. March 10th, we’re prepared. We’re doing a great job with it. It will go away. Just stay calm, it will go away. What do you say to Americans who believe that you got this wrong?
