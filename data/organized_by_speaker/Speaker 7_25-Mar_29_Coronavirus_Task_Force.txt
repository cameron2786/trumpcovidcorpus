Thank you. Thank you mister president. We appreciate the opportunity to work with your administration on a lot of collaborative fronts. Number one, we’ve all talked about PE products. That’s critical and it’s not just to the hospitals, that’s a must, but it’s really to all healthcare providers out there working on the front line. So our commitment is there to get it to the hotspots and get it to the care providers that are taking care of those patients. It’s absolutely key. Second, we talked in there about buying in America and getting resources back here and manufacturing in America. That is critical, a lesson to be learned from where we are. And lastly, we’re proud that we introduced a test. We need to get some more tests out there in a rapid form. We’re excited about that. We’ve worked with your administration very closely in the FDA and we’re very grateful for that, because it’s a quick rapid antibody tests that’s needed as well. So we’re really proud to work with the administration <inaudible 00:18:47>. Thanks so much.
