Thank you Secretary for those words and thank you Mr. President for your leadership and I want to publicly thank Admiral Craig Fowler, the commander of U.S. Southern Command out of Miami for leading this operation, which is underway effective today. And also at Admiral Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Schultz for their contributions to this from their services. There’s thousands of sailors, Coast Guardsman, soldiers, airmen, Marines involved in this operation. We came upon some intelligence sometime ago that the drug cartels as a result of COVID-19 were going to try to take advantage of the situation and try to infiltrate additional drugs into our country. As we know that 70,000 Americans die on an average annual basis to drugs, that’s unacceptable. We’re at war with COVID-19, we’re at war with terrorists and we are at war with the drug cartels as well. This was the United States military, you will not penetrate this country. You will not get past jump street. You’re not going to come in here and kill additional Americans.

And we will marshal whatever assets are required to prevent your entry into this country to kill Americans. So right now the Navy has marshaled additional grey hull ships from both PACOM and EUCOM and for the Naval fleet at Norfolk. And they are set sail already and they’re in the Caribbean right now. In addition to that, there’s 10 Coast Guard Cutters and there’s special operations forces and security force assistance brigades along with Air Force reconnaissance aircraft. The bottom line is you’re not going to get through. Now is not the time to try to penetrate the United States with illegal drugs to kill Americans. We’re the United States military and we will defend our country, regardless of the cost. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Secretary.
