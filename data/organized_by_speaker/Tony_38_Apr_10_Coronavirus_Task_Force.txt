Thank you. A quick one and then a longer one. First of all-
<01:33:44>
Well, at least answer my questions, yeah.
<01:33:46>
Have you had a chance to speak to-
<01:33:50>
Have you had a chance yet to speak to Boris Johnson since it came out-
<01:34:11>
Slightly more complicated one-
<01:34:40>
If I may, where do you see the use of something like immunity certificates or documents or passports? When we get to anti-
<01:34:49>

I just thought for ordinary Americans who are currently stuck at home, if they’re tested for antibodies, it turns out they’ve had the disease and therefore, shouldn’t be infected again. Some sort of documentation that would allow them to go back to work safely.
<01:35:52>
Yeah-
<01:37:10>
One more question.
