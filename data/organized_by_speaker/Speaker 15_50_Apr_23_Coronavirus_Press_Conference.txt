Thank you, Mr. President. In a new interview today with TIME magazine, Dr. Fauci said that the U.S. is not in a situation where we can say we are where we want to be with regard to testing capacity. He said we need much more testing capacity as well as tests. So why do you keep saying we have a tremendous testing capacity, and do we have a national strategy that goes beyond tracking just what the states are doing?

Do you agree with Dr. Fauci that we’re just not there yet?
