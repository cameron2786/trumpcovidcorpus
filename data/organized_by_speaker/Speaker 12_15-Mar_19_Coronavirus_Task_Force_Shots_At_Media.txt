Thank you, Mr. President. One for you and potentially, as well, one for either Dr. Birx or Dr. Adams. Right now the economy is essentially ground to a halt-
<01:02:56>
Stores have closed. Travel has slowed down-
<01:03:03>
The question is how long should those who are either not working right now or business owners who have to make critical decisions, how long should they expect the state of affairs as it stands at this moment to play out? And for the doctors behind you-
<01:03:46>
Okay, and for all the parents that are home right now, and this is a question for Dr. Birx or Dr. Adams, who are caring for their children and are curious as to when might my kids be able to go back to school, what do you think is a realistic timeline?
<01:05:22>
Do you have a general timeline, Doctor?
