Yeah. Yes. I think it’s sporadic because I talked to my colleagues around the country certainly there are pockets of areas where PPE is not ideal. But this is an unprecedented time and the infection control measures that we learned back when we went to school one gown, one mask for one patient a day or per time. This is a different time and I’ve been reusing my N95 masks for a few weeks now. I just broke out a new one to come here just in case I needed to wear it. To answer your question earlier, we’re all COVID-19 free, we were all tested. So we’re not socially distancing but we’re all negative, then we wouldn’t do anything to harm our president obviously.

Yeah we were all tested.

We were all tested, we’re all negative. And so that’s why we’re not socially distancing and why we’re not wearing masks. Certainly I’ve had several tests throughout this whole COVID-19 crisis. I practice in New Orleans at a community health center. My youngest patient has been four days old, a four day old infant. And so PPE has been sporadic, but it’s been manageable and we do what we have to do. We’re nurses and we learn to adapt and do whatever the best thing that we can do for our patients to get the job done and get the care provided. And that’s what we’re going to continue to do as COVID-19 continues.

Oh no, I agree Mr. President.
