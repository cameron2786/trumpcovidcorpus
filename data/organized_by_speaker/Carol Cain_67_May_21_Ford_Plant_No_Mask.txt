Mr. President, can I ask you a question?
<02:58>
So my question to you is this. Thanks to all the work of manufacturers like Ford and-
<03:08>
I’m Carol Cain with CBS in Detroit and Detroit Free Press.
<03:12>
My question to you is this. Because of all the ventilators being made here at Ford, and the heroic efforts of all the manufacturers there at <inaudible 00:03:20>, we now know we have enough manufacturing going on for the time being as far as the ventilator goes. You said you think we have enough, in fact, can share with other countries. My question to you, sir, is looking six months from now, a year from now, how much do we need to keep back in our stockpile to keep us safe?
<05:45>
Mr. President.
<05:53>
No, it was a great question. Here’s a question for you. So, you have seen-
<05:57>
There we go.
<05:58>
We’ve seen the manufacturers here, Ford, GM, <inaudible 00:00:06:00>, others, small businesses, turning things overnight and making PPE materials. As someone who is the President of the United States, in terms of our manufacturing might, how do you see what’s taken place in these last months?
<06:43>
Hi Bill. How are you doing?
William Ford, Jr.: <06:43>
Well, you know what we’re making. We’ve got the pressure respirators, obviously the ventilators, the masks, the gowns, really anything that anybody needs. We responded quickly and we’re very proud of our workforce. They’ve been amazing.
<06:58>
He is. In fact, Bill, you have been through so many crises through your years as Chairman and CEO of the company here. How does this crisis, dealing with this pandemic, making PPE materials compare?
William Ford, Jr.: <07:10>
Well, everyone’s different. I mean, I won’t take you through all of them going all the way back to maybe the oil shocks and then the dot com meltdowns and all those. Every crisis is different, but what’s amazing is how our people responded. And this one, they didn’t wait to be asked to do something. They said, “Here’s an opportunity, and let’s go.” What I love about our culture is they didn’t ask for permission. They just went, and that’s something that we’ve done throughout our 117 year history, and I hope we’ll always do.
