Yes. Thank you, President Trump. New York is currently the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., with about half of the cases. Yesterday, Kellyanne Conway laid a lot of the blame for that on the mayor, pointing out that he told people to go about life as normal and he resisted closing schools and businesses. I’m wondering if you agree. And also if I could ask you your thoughts on the stimulus bill preventing aid to your businesses. Do you think that’s fair, and what are your thoughts on that?
