Dr. Fauci, what happens when governor’s like governor Kemp are not following this careful measured plan and moving forward even without meeting the gating criteria? What do we do about that?

You talk a lot about testing capacity and governors agree that that exists, but it’s very different from testing implementation and they are still begging for you to use your full authority to help them get reagents and other things. As you would like to say, what do you have to lose by helping them do that and becoming the king of testing?

0.2% of the population has been tested. Is that good enough?
