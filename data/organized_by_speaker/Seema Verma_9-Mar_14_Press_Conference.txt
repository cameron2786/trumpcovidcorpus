Thank you, Mr. Vice President. As the President and the Vice President said, we did take action last night to indicate that nursing homes should restrict all visitors effective immediately and that includes all non-essential personnel. There are some exceptions for end of life. We are also canceling all group activities and communal dining and there is active screening of healthcare workers that are in the facility.

The emergency declaration, as Dr. Fauci said, is also very important to our healthcare workforce. There’s a lot more flexibility that they have. For example, they can have workers from across state lines, and doctors and nurses that can help them. Hospitals have the ability to move patients around, so that’s also going to be very helpful as they go forward with this.

Also with the nursing homes, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago that we had a call to action for all healthcare facilities to double down around infection control practices. We have now come up with some very specific guidance for our surveyors and we have already begun the process of going into nursing homes, especially the ones that had a history of problems with infection control. And those inspections have already started. We’ve been doing those in Washington state and California, New York, but we’ll be increasing those over the coming weeks. Thank you.
