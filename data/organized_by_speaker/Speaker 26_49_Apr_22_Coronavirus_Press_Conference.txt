I think the comments that we made when we came into face masks, and I think it’s important, when we came out with the CDC guidance about face masks or what we called face coverings, was in recognition of the growing understanding of asymptomatic infection or presymptomatic infection, was the recognition that we could use a barrier, and the reason… And I have mine when I’m in public right here, that I use. That this barrier, in case I was in fact infected if I didn’t know, is a barrier to prevent me to protect you in case I happened to be asymptomatically infected. There’s very good data to show that the ability of viral particles to go through a barrier is substantially diminished. And that’s why we recommended these face coverings, I think if you go back to when CDC came out with that recommendation. Some people may think intuitively it’s to protect them from getting infected. No, it was to protect you from potentially getting infected by me when I go out in public. <inaudible 01:24:46>.
