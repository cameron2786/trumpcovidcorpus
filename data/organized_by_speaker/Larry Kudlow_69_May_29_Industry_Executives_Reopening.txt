Thank you, sir. Thanks to everybody who’s come here and worked with us, and I hope everything continues apace. We try to follow, Kevin Hassett and I try to follow these high frequency economic indicators, and my little list is growing. I’ll just rattle it off, because things as things open safely, I say that because Deb is here, truckloads, freight shipping, air travel, hotel, bookings, TSA travelers, all starting to shoot up. They’re really green shoots.

You mentioned the stock market, sir, which has done very well. Apple mobility, gasoline demand, tremendous housing demand, applications for mortgages and so forth, they’re actually now pre pandemic levels again with low interest rates. We had number today from the income report. The saving rate, sir, is 33% for the month of April, 33%. Which is to say, we’ve given them a lot of income, government income has boosted things, liquidity, cash, and so forth. Steven’s great efforts on Capitol Hill. And of course the stores have been closed. They have nowhere to spend, so they’re saving at a 33% rate. That’s almost 10 times the norm. So that, my final point, as we open and as the stores open, we are going to see a boom in spending at the store. A boom.

Yes, sir.
