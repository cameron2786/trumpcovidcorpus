Thank you mister president for the incredible leadership. I will share with you that UPS is really proud to be part of this effort. Vice President Pence and I had the opportunity to speak before and the way we’re going to win this war is with great logistics, and UPS is going to be part of that effort. We have a big brown army, 495,000 UPSers across the country that are ready to deliver. We’re bringing in the supplies from anywhere around the world as fast as we can so that they can serve the communities that need them most. We’re proud to be partnering with the states as well, because we know that in partnership with those states we can deliver what is needed everywhere, so thank you mister president.
