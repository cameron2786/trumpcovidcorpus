I have two questions if I may, one from somebody outside of the room. But first, do you think Boris Johnson, when he talked about so shaking hands of hospital patients, did he downplay the threat of this virus too much and do you know exactly what his current condition is?

Just somebody would can’t be in the room because of social distancing has asked me to ask a question. It’s a Thomas Howell of the Washington Times, how many health workers in the US have become infected with COVID-19? If the answer is not know, will the CDC be publishing that data?
