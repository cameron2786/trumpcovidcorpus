Thank you. Well, before you came in, Mr. President, we talked about which Americans are most vulnerable and the fact that younger Americans may not be as vulnerable. So we’re really focused very much in that way and I think the airline industry can help us also in any kind of screening required, particularly to protect our older Americans.

Well, we’re always saying the common sense of washing your hands, not touching your face, ensuring that if you’ve touched anything, you go and wash your hands again, 20 seconds with soap. Hand sanitizers also work, but I think I was very reassured to hear the airlines talk about their cleaning procedures and there are three levels of cleaning procedures because I think that will be reassuring to the American public.
