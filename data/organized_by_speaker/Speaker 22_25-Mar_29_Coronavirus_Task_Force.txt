Thank you.
<01:09:14>
Thank you, Mr. President.
<01:09:18>
Thank you, sir.
<01:09:21>
Two quick questions. First of all, during this 30-day additional period, do you anticipate at all relaxing those restrictions by region during these additional 30 days-
<01:09:31>
Or no?
<01:10:00>
Secondly, sir, I want to ask you about some <crosstalk 01:10:01>-
<01:10:03>
Thank you, sir. I’d also like to ask you about some comments you made on Friday. You were talking about governors of different states and you said, “I want them to be appreciative.” You also said if they don’t treat you right-
<01:10:13>
I don’t call-
<01:10:15>
These are direct-
<01:10:15>
Direct quotes, sir.
<01:10:26>
You and of your administration, absolutely <crosstalk 01:10:27>-
<01:10:32>
I could read you your full comments, sir <crosstalk 01:10:34>-
<01:10:35>
If that would be easier.
<01:10:46>
You said, “I want <crosstalk 01:10:47> them to be appreciative. I don’t want them to say things that aren’t true. I want them to be appreciative. We’ve done a great job, and I’m not talking about me, I’m talking about Mike Pence, the task force. I’m talking about FEMA <crosstalk 01:10:56>-
<01:10:56>
The Army Corps of Engineers-
<01:10:58>
But then you went on to say, “If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call. He’s a different type of person”, you said <crosstalk 01:11:02>-
<01:11:02>
Referring to the Vice President <crosstalk 01:11:03>-
<01:11:03>
Referring to the Vice President <crosstalk 01:11:04>-
<01:11:06>
Why in this time <crosstalk 01:11:07>-
<01:11:47>
Yeah, you <crosstalk 01:11:47>-
<01:12:44>
Why is the lack of approval <crosstalk 01:12:45>-
<01:12:46>
Something as important in the midst of <crosstalk 01:12:47>-
<01:13:13>
We’re not fake news.
