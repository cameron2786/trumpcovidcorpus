In terms of Americans who find themselves stranded in places where there are no longer flights to get back to the United States. What efforts are being made to help them?
Sec. Pompeo: <01:02:11>
I appreciate that question. So we’re doing lots of things. We’ve had a couple of places in particular Peru and Morocco. I think we’ve had the first two, maybe three now flights out of Morocco. We’re going to work to get people back. We’re urging individuals when they can get back on their own, they traveled there on their own. When they can get back there on their own, they ought to try to do that. But we have a team stood up at the state department, the repatriation task force that is working each of these instances. So we’ve heard from individuals, members of Congress, we’re trying to get Americans back from these places where air travel has been disrupted and we’ll get that done over time. We’ll get it done successfully.

Do you have any sense of how big that problem is?

Is there any sense of just how big that problem is-
Sec. Pompeo: <01:02:50>
We don’t know the full scale of it yet, but we think we have the largest number identified and we’re working, those who are watching that are someplace and you can get up and go on to state department website, you can log in to, I think step.gov and go step and login and we’ll track it and we’ll try to get everybody back as fast as we can.
