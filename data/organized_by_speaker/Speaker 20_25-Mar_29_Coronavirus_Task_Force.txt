Mr. President, states like Florida have reportedly had 100% of their requests for supplies from the national strategic stockpile filled, but other states like Massachusetts have not, so how was that assessment being made and why has Florida gotten its request fulfilled?
<01:00:40>
But why has Florida received 100% of its requests compared to some other states, is there a reason?
<01:02:12>
And may I ask-
<01:02:15>
Okay.
<01:03:28>
Sir, sir, may I just follow up on your letter to the governors that you sent, since we were on the topic of governors, you sent a letter to governors at the end of the week saying that you guys were going to be developing criteria to be-
<01:03:39>
… able to classify counties-
<01:03:42>
… based on whether they were hotspots, or whatnot, and I wanted to know if you have enough tests currently to be able to accurately rank those counties?
