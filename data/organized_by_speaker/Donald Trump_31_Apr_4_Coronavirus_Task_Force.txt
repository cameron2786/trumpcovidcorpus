Thank you very much. Busy time, very busy time. And let me begin by again expressing our support, solidarity, and love for the people of our great country. We’re fighting for you and we’re enduring all of this together and we will soon prevail together and they get a lot of progress. We appreciate all of the great assistance from the governors and people within the states, the relationships have been really very good. I spoke with Governor Cuomo, were working very hard to get additional things to New York as quickly as possible. We, as you know, we took care of the hospital including personnel, the 2,500 beds that we built just recently, a Javits including personnel, and we opened it up to COVID and it’s something that we also did in Louisiana and we’re doing it in Dallas. So we have a lot of, not only hospitals being built, but now we’re manning the hospitals because States are in many cases unable to get additional people to work, it’s just an incredible situation. There’s never been anything like this.
<02:32>
One of the most important issues in battling this pandemic is coordinating the delivery of the crucial supplies throughout the nation based upon the most accurate information available and we’ve got the best healthcare and disaster experts anywhere in the world and everybody will tell you that and we’re dealing with big parts of the world on helping them also through this horrible situation where 151, still 151, nations are going through it. We’re working to ensure that the supplies are delivered where and when they’re needed. In some cases we’re telling governors, “We can’t go there because we don’t think you need it and we think someplace else needs it.” Then pretty much so far we’ve been right about that and we’ll continue to do it as it really gets, this will be probably the toughest week between this week and next week and there’ll be a lot of death unfortunately, but a lot less death than if this wasn’t done, but there will be death.
<03:35>
We’re looking for an obvious focus and the hardest hit regions. Some of them are obvious and some aren’t so obvious. They spring up. They come and they hit you like you got hit by a club, an area that wasn’t at all bothered. You look at what’s going on in New Jersey. The governor’s doing an excellent job by the way, but how that sprang up. Every decision that we’re making is made to save lives. It’s really our sole consideration. We want to save lives. We want as few lives lost as possible. It’s therefore critical that certain media outlets stop spreading false rumors and creating fear and even panic with the public. It’s just incredible. I could name them, but it’s the same ones always the same ones. I guess they’re looking for ratings, I don’t know what they’re looking for, so bad for our country and so bad that people understand it. You look at the levels and approval ratings are the lowest they’ve ever been for media. It’s so bad for our country, so bad for the world. You got to put it together for a little while, get this over with and then go back to your fakeness. During a national emergency it’s just essential that the federal decision makers cut through the fog of confusion in order to follow the facts and the science.
<04:58>
Many hospital administrators that we’ve been in touch with, even in the really hot spots, you know what they are, are communicating directly with us that their level of supplies are meeting essential needs and at the current time they’re really thrilled to be where they are. Whenever local shortages are reported, we’re asking states to immediately meet the demand and we’re stockpiling large amounts in different areas, in different areas, and we’re going to be discussing that in a little while, but we want distributions to be made on a fair basis. We have to take care of a large country, not just certain areas of the country. But no matter where we’ve been there and we’ve been there very strong.
<05:46>
I want to thank FEMA, I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers, I want to thank our military for what they’re doing. And we’re going to be adding a tremendous amount of military to help supplement the states. Thousands of soldiers, thousands of medical workers, professionals, nurses, doctors, and it’ll be a large number, it’ll be, we’ll be telling them over the next very short period where they’re going. They’re going into war, they’re going into a battle that they’ve never really trained for. Nobody’s trained for this, nobody’s seen this, I would say since 1917 which was the greatest of them all. The greatest of this type of battle, probably the greatest of them all right? 1917. Up to a hundred million people were killed.
<06:39>
In addition, we’re working directly with hospitals and existing suppliers and distributors to ensure that those with the greatest need are prioritized and that need changes. One day it’s one state or one locale, one city, and then all of a sudden they’re starting to do well. We had some very good reports coming out of the state of Washington, coming out of various parts of California, so areas that we were getting ready to really hit hard, we can now go to other areas. It looks like New York is going to be hit very hard and Louisiana is just amazing the way it just spread up and everyone’s doing a good job, but they’re going to be hit hard. Areas in the country that are not experiencing large scale infections are requesting supplies beyond what their present circumstances require and we talked to them or we tell them and we explain it and for the most part they’re good with it. We think we’re right.
<07:36>
It’s very understandable that officials would seek to get the most they can get for their communities, but the fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests. We have some states and areas where they’re just asking for far more. Look, we had one state asking for 40,000 ventilators, 40,000 think of it. 40, 000. It’s not possible. They won’t need that many and now they’re admitting they don’t need that many, but we’re getting as many as we can to them.
<08:10>
Again, nobody’s ever seen anything like this in terms of ventilators, in terms of protective equipment and uniforms and outfits, but it makes it more difficult for distributors to prioritize the real need and it could intentionally and everybody has proper intentions but they want to make sure they’re 100% and sometimes when they know they don’t need it, they want it anyway. It gives them that extra feeling of satisfaction, but we just can’t do that. It’s not even possible to think about it. And that’s why, and we’re backup. Remember we’re a backup. We’re the greatest backup that ever existed for the states, especially when we start getting into hospital building business and getting into the medical center building business. When you see we built many hospitals, numerous hospitals in some states and medical centers. That’s why my administration’s been requesting actual usage numbers directly from the States and hospitals to meet their needs because we want to be ready when the brunt of it comes, which is coming quickly, you see it, you see it as sure as you can see it, and when the brunt of it comes, we want to be ready to hit the area that needs it. We don’t want to have spent everything in one area and they don’t need it there to anywhere near the extent.
<09:31>
So, let me be extremely clear about one point. We will move heaven and earth to safeguard our great American citizens. We will continue to use every power, every authority, every single resource, we’ve got to keep our people healthy, safe, secure, and to get this thing over with. We want to finish this war. We have to get back to work. We have to open our country again. We have to open our country again. We don’t want to be doing this for months and months and months. We’re going to open our country again. This country wasn’t meant for this fewer, fewer, but we have to open our country again.
<10:17>
I just spoke with the commissioners, leaders of, I would say virtually all of the sports leagues. Rob Manfred, Commissioner of Baseball, Major League Baseball, Roger Goodell, Commissioner of the National Football League, Adam Silver, Commissioner of the National Basketball Association, Gary Bettman, Commissioner of the National Hockey League, Jay Monaghan, Commissioner of the PGA Tour, Cathy Engelbert, Commissioner of the Women’s National Basketball Association. Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Vince McMan, President of the WWE, Don Garber, Commissioner of Major League Soccer, Steve Phelps, President of NASCAR, Michael Wahn, Commissioner of the LPGA, Roger Penske, founder and Chairman Penske Corp and Drew Fleming, President of the Breeders’ Cup, and there were a couple of others on and these are all the great leaders of sport and they want to get back, they got to get back. They can’t do this. The sports weren’t designed for it. The whole concept of our nation wasn’t designed for, we’re going to have to get back. We want to get back soon. Very soon.
<11:36>
For example, and I have to say we’re using the Defense Production Act very powerfully and sometimes directly, in many cases indirectly, just the threat of it’s usually enough, but FEMA and HHS have ordered 180 million, think of that, 180 million who have a herd of 180,000,000 N95 masks? And we’re working now with 3M to see whether or not that all works out, but we want them to help our country and I think it’s going to be okay. We’re going to soon let you know, but we need the masks. We don’t want other people getting it. That’s why we’re instituting a lot of Defense Production Act … You could call it retaliations because that’s what it is. It’s a retaliation. If people don’t, if people don’t give us what we need for our people, we’re going to be very tough and we’ve been very tough. Usually we don’t have to use it, but we’ve used it plenty. It’s turning out more and more unfortunately, and it works very well.
<12:48>
Our supply chain logistics task force led by Admiral John Polowczyk is doing a fantastic job, will ensure they are distributed through the healthcare and critical infrastructure workers in the areas with the most pressing requirements. That’s the 60 million masks that we’re talking about and the 180,000,000 N95 mass, 180 million, whoever heard of 180 million masks? And this is a incredible thing. A lot of times that we have to stop playing this game, if a governor wants 200 ventilators and I say “No, we’re going to send you a thousand, we think you need more than 200,” and then the media meets with the governor and they say, “Oh you got more, well, it’s not enough. The president should have sent more.” So he’s asking for 200 we give him thousand, they say, “How’s the president doing? He should have given more,” because that’s politics. That’s politics. And that’s unfortunate because we can’t play that game. And you know that’s one party doing it and the other party’s happy, but they’re all really happy because they should have been doing this work themselves for a long period of time.
<14:05>
Many of their cupboards were bare with respect to the ventilators. FEMA and HHS continued to monitor the data on an hourly basis where provided by the States in order to most effectively target the distribution of supplies. We’ve been asking States to provide us with daily updates on the number of ventilators and their utilization rates because some states have more ventilators than they need. They don’t even like to admit it. They’ll admit it when everything’s over, but that’s doesn’t help us very much. This data is vitally necessary so that we can ensure ventilators are getting to the right place at the right time. FEMA, HHS, DOD are developing resources within the next 24 hours. They will have a whole different set of criteria every day. It’s different criteria every day. This horrible invisible enemy changes. Of course, it changes course.
<15:05>
If you were fighting the normal fight, you know what’s happening. Here’s, they hit one, they hit another. They had another state. They hit areas that you didn’t expect, but we’re watching it and we’re capturing it. Our goal is to stay several days ahead of the needs in each state, but we can only do that if the cities and states utilize real time, local knowledge to provide timely and precise data about actual usage. So, we have to be able to do that.
<15:37>
And if a state has ventilators, as an example, that they know they’re not going to need, they should give them over and we should move them with the other ones. We have now 10,000 in our pipeline and stockpiled 10,000 close and we’re moving some into New York because we’re going to need some additional, we’re moving some into New York City and State separately and we’re bringing them to the point where they’ll need them.
<16:05>
I can also report that at my direction, 1000 military personnel are deploying to New York City to assist where they’re needed the most. That’s the hottest of all the hotspots. New Jersey is right there. It’s right next to it and I don’t know if that’s overflow, but New Jersey’s, it’s a great state and it’s a very, it’s a crowded state also where you have people on top of people. It’s always tough, but we’re bringing some of the ventilators. We got some for New Jersey just yesterday and we’re going to bring them some more including doctors. We’re getting doctors, nurses, respiratory specialist, and other support workers. These are from the military. We’re taking people now out of our military. We’ve been doing it, but now we’re doing it on a larger basis and I want to thank Secretary of Defense Esper who will detail some of what we’re doing tomorrow and Monday.
<16:56>
As the situation in Washington State continues to stabilize, we’re returning a 300 bed federal medical station to a different location, so where we need it and we appreciate that they won’t be needing it and we appreciate them letting us know we’re going to move it to a different location. It was already built.
<17:18>
Many governors initially made large requests for federal support for their states in anticipation of a greater number of cases, but the residents of Washington State have done a really good job of following the federal distancing guidelines. They really have.
<17:35>
I’m also pleased to report that Oregon will be spending and sending. They’re spending a lot of money because they really did stockpile well and they’re also sending 140 ventilators directly to New York, which we appreciate.
<17:50>
And I want to thank the Vice President for the great work he’s doing every day dealing with our nation’s governors. Mike Pence has been working day and night on this and we want to get it over. He’s got to get a little more sleep than he’s getting. He hasn’t been getting very much, I will tell you that, and we’re all in this together. It’s a beautiful thing to see how people are joining forces to help one another. They really are.
<18:15>
In addition to our courageous doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, I also want to thank the incredible food supply workers who are feeding our nation. I spoke just a little while ago to Senator Bozeman, you know Senator Bozeman, we all do, he’s a great Senator, he’s a great person. We spoke just this morning and we discussed how important it is to keep our farmers and ranchers, processors and distributors in our nation’s prayers and I want to thank the Senator for the incredible job he’s been doing. And a lot of the senators and congressmen and everyone. Everybody’s working very hard.
<18:56>
My administration is working very aggressively to pioneer new medical countermeasures to treat and prevent infection working on a lot of things. We must utilize our nation’s scientific brilliance to vanquish the virus. We have to vanquish the virus as quickly as we can because we have a lot of things happening in this country and we have a great future, but we have to get back to work.
<19:29>
This week the FDA established the Coronavirus treatment accelerator program, which is expediting the development of new antiviral and other therapies and they’re doing it on a very rapid basis and I think we’re having some very good results. We’ll tell you about that.
<19:49>
HHS continues to speed the development of therapies derived from human blood that have the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of the illness. And as you know, last Saturday the FDA also gave emergency authorization for hydroxy chloroquine and the hydroxy chloroquine is a, I hope it’s going to be a very important answer. We’re having some very good things happening with it and we’re going to be distributing it through the strategic national stockpile. It’s going into these strategic national stockpile to treat certain patients and we have millions and millions of doses of it, 29 million to be exact. In addition to that, we’re making it and we’re also getting it from various other locations and countries. In one case I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning, they make large amounts of hydroxy chloroquine very large amounts frankly.
<21:02>
And I said, they had a hold because you know they have 1.5 billion people and they think a lot of it and I said I’d appreciate if they would release the amounts that we ordered and they are giving it serious consideration. But India makes a lot of it, but we have already 29 million, if you look it’s a big number, 29 million doses and we’ve got millions of doses that are being made here and many millions of doses that are made elsewhere that are being shipped here and it will be arriving. We’re just hearing really positive stories and we’re continuing to collect the data, but I’ll just speak for myself. It’s been out for a long time.
<21:53>
It’s a malaria drug. It’s also a drug for lupus and there’s a study out that people with lupus aren’t catching this horrible virus, they’re not affected so much by it. Now, maybe that’s correct. Maybe it’s false. You’re going to have to check it out, but there’s a lot of very positive things happening with that. That’s a game changer. If that’s the case, obviously we continue to work on the vaccines, but the vaccines have to be down the road by probably 14, 15, 16 months.
<22:25>
We’re doing great on the vaccines. I think Johnson and Johnson is leading … Seems to be leading in terms of the studies, but we’ll see what happens. But I feel good about that. But that’s down the road. But a tremendous promise with what’s just been mentioned.
<22:43>
In addition to that, Gilead Sciences has initiated a phase three that’s down the line, meaning clinical studies of the drug, remdesivir, now it’s approximately 1,000 patients, which is a pretty good study. Other drugs are also being studied in patients and this week Oracle, great company donated a new web portal. Larry Ellison, amazing guy and platform to the government to gather real time data on how patients are responding to the various new treatments and they have a very sophisticated site. We’ll be learning a lot from Oracle and thank you to them.
<23:26>
We’re also spending economic dollars like you wouldn’t believe and speeding economic relief to American workers, families, and businesses. Yesterday the Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection Program to help employees keep paying their workers. In 24 hours, the Small Business Administration and over 1,200 lending partners processed over 28,000 loans. It’s so far ahead of schedule and billions and billions of dollars. It’s worked out incredibly well and I want to thank Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase and a lot of the big banks that have been involved and a lot of the community banks, community banks have really jumped on it and it’s a so far going way ahead of schedule. The SBA also clarified that faith-based organizations, including houses of worship, are eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program. That’s great. As well as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program that you’re familiar with on the same terms as every other applicant. If we run out of funding for the Employee Retention Program, I will immediately ask Congress for more money. This is money that’s really going directly to the people that need it, the small businesses that need it and the workers that need it.
<24:54>
Finally, because when we open, we want to open strong with businesses that are going. Remember we had the greatest economy in the world and then one day we were told, “You got to shut it down. Stop it. Tell everyone to stay home because of this horrible virus.” And we did that and we did the right thing, but now we have to open. We have to open our country.
<25:18>
Finally, I can report that as of today, the State Department has successfully coordinated the safe return of more than 40,000 Americans stuck abroad on over 400 flights from 75 countries. Many of those countries were terrific in helping us and I appreciate that very much. Some of them, I had to call the leaders of the country, most of whom I know, and once I did, they snapped like you wouldn’t believe. They really helped us great, so I appreciate that. So we brought back 40,000 Americans who were literally stuck in some countries with no chance of getting out. We got them back. 400 flights, 75 countries. Think of that. And those countries in almost every instance had a big problem with a virus.
<26:02>
I want to thank the American people, most of all for the selfless sacrifices that they’re making for our nation. I know it’s not pleasant. Although some people have said they’ve gotten to know their family better and they love their family more than ever, and that’s a beautiful thing. They’ve actually gotten to know them. They’re in the same house with their family for a long time. I guess it can also work the other way perhaps, but we don’t want to talk about that.
<26:29>
And I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on slowing the spread. Sustaining this war effort is, and that’s what it is, it’s a war effort, is the patriotic duty of every citizen. While we may be more physically distant for a time, we’re closer together in the heart and in the spirit and through this great national unity is happening, we’re having a great unity developing that a lot of people didn’t think it would be possible to develop like this and we will conquer the disease and restore our nation to its full and
<27:03>
… the disease and restore our nation to its full and glorious might. We’re doing really well and I’m very proud of everybody out there. We’re very proud of you. It’s something that nobody could have ever projected. It’s been over a hundred years that a thing like this has happened. And the problem with this one is the contagion. It’s so contagious. Nobody’s ever seen anything like that where it’s so contagious. You can be feet away and just talking to somebody and catch it. You can catch it … you know how long it can live on surfaces. So things that nobody even thought of, the level of contagion.
<27:40>
So we’re getting there. We’re going to make sure that it’s over soon and just keep going. It’s not going to be long and thank you very much. And with that, I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn to speak and he’s been doing yeoman’s work at the FDA. Thank you very much, doctor. Thank you.
<29:59>
Tony, please.
<33:47>
Thank you. Okay, please.
<34:04>
I don’t think so. There are some States that you have great distance, natural distance, big land, few people, and they’re in very good shape. And if there is a case, they can quarantine that person or that person will be separated, will be brought to a hospital, a secure area. So you do have different cases as opposed to a New York or Los Angeles. Los Angeles is doing incredibly well by the way. But areas where you have lots of people tight together is a big difference. So no, there are many different cases. Please?
<34:45>
Many of the places are really in great shape, they really have done a fantastic job, and we may add to the thousand. But New York will be getting about a thousand military people, nurses, doctors, lots of other people because that’s what they need. <crosstalk 00:35:01> Medical, no, no, medical military. Please?
<35:15>
Thinking about it, getting a group of people. We have to open our country. I had an expression: The cure can’t be worse than the problem itself. I started by saying that and I continue to say it. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. We’ve got to get our country open.
<35:44>
Absolutely, I want fans back in the arenas. I think it’s <crosstalk 00:35:48> … No, whenever we’re ready. As soon as we can, obviously. And the fans want to be back too. They want to see basketball, and baseball, and football, and hockey. They want to see their sports, they want to go out onto the golf courses and breathe nice, clean, beautiful, fresh air.
<36:08>
I can’t tell you a date, but I think it’s going to be sooner rather than later. We’re not going to have to have separation for the rest of our times on the planet. We need it for this period of time, but eventually people are going to be able to occupy those seats in arenas next to each other like we have for all of my life and all of your life. They want to sit next to each other at restaurants. They don’t want to be six feet away.
<36:37>
Some restaurant man called up. He said, “I’m worried because I have a small restaurant with not too many seats.” I think he said 120. And he said, “If I practice what this is, I’m down to 30 seats. I can’t make it.” I said, “Don’t worry about it. That’s for a short period of time. You’ll be back to your number of seats.” We can’t do that. Otherwise you’re making everything. That means your stadium is half the size of what it was a month ago. No, no, they’re going to be close together, but they’re going to be breathing air that’s not infected, that’s not going to kill people. Please?
<37:13>
I’m not committing to it. We’re going to see where we are. That’d be great if we could. But we’re going to be back to good health soon, in my opinion. We’re making a lot of progress. And we’re making progress because, as Tony told a story about the restaurant and about how they were separated sort of automatically, people are doing that. They’re staying in their homes, they don’t want to go out, they’re doing what they know is the right thing to do. It’s not very complicated. In many ways, it’s a very beautiful thing to see. Yeah?
<37:48>
We have no contingency plan. We’re having the convention at the end of August and we think by the end of August we’ll be in good shape. We have no contingency. It’s going to be in North Carolina, as you know, in Charlotte, and I think we’re going to have a great convention. I notice … I think we had an opponent, but I almost didn’t know who it was. He got .00001% of the vote, but I heard he dropped out three or four weeks ago. I’m not sure, maybe you could tell me. That’s the kind of opponent I had, and hopefully we have another one just like that in Joe.
<38:32>
Well, I think we’re going to need more money for the small businesses. It’s been working out so well, it’s been so efficient. The banks have been doing an incredible job. I think we’re going to need more money there. I think, we’ll see. But based on the first couple of days, it’s been incredible. I think that restaurants and entertainment, that would be sports leagues, all forms of entertainment, go back to the original where they get tax deductibility for what they’re doing, and for people who come in and buy tickets or go out for meals. And corporations can then send people into these restaurants who are going to have a hard time otherwise opening in my opinion. And that could be the same for the sports leagues.
<39:13>
So we want to see, for entertainment and for restaurants, deductibility, so that corporations can take a deduction. They’ll send their executives, they’ll send people there, and they get a deduction. That is something that will really bring life back to the restaurants, I think. Make them hotter than before. They used to have it, and when they ended it, it was really never the same. It was never the same. Yeah, please?
<40:00>
We have a thing called the constitution, which I cherish, number one. Number two, those governors, I know every one of them, they’re doing a great job. They’re being very, very successful in what they’re doing. And as you know, I want the governors to be running things. Now in some cases, we’ll supersede, but in this case it’s not <crosstalk 00:40:20>. It depends on the individual state that you’re talking about. But they’re doing very well, and they’re doing a magnificent job in running their states.
<40:36>
No, I think they’re doing a great job. That’s a very small number relative to population.
<40:43>
It’s up to them. If I saw something wrong, if I saw a massive breakout, of which that’s not, I would come down very hard.
<40:54>
No, not in that case, but in the case … I know the states you’re talking about. By the way, I think you’re up to 92% of the country is covered. And from a constitutional standpoint, they made the difference, they called the shots. Yes, Jeff, go ahead?
<41:21>
I’m just saying we have to get this country open, Jeff. It has to get open. This country was not designed to be closed. So we have the greatest we’ve ever had and then we’re paying people to stay home? Well, think of it. We’re paying people not to go to work. How about that? How does that play? And they want to go to work, by the way. They don’t want money. This country is great. But we’re paying people, we have to get back to work. That’s what I’m saying. Go ahead, please?
<42:19>
I thought he did a terrible job, absolutely terrible. He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report … it was fake, it was totally wrong. It was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine. He took a fake report and he brought it to Congress with an emergency. Not a big Trump fan, that I can tell you. Instead of saying, and we offered this to him, “No, no, we will tape the conversation” … we’re fortunate we had that transcript. If we didn’t have a transcript, with the kind of a deception and dishonesty that were practiced by the Democrats, I might not be standing here right now. Fortunately, we had a transcript. And it was a perfect transcript because even the Lieutenant Colonel admitted it was correct.
<43:07>
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute. You asked that question. So he took this whistleblower and I keep saying, where’s the whistleblower, and why was the whistleblower allowed to do this? Why was he allowed to be, you call it, fraudulent or incorrect transcript. So we offered this IG … I don’t know him, I don’t think I ever met him, he never even came in to see me. How can you do that without seeing the person? He never came into see me, never requested to see me. He took this terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report, and he brought it to Congress. We offered to have him see my exact conversation. It was all about the conversation, by the way. That was the whole thing. It was about the conversation. And then after he saw it, he must have said, “Wow,” because, as I’ve said it many times, and it drives you people crazy, it was a perfect conversation.
<43:58>
So instead of going and saying, ” Gee, this is a terrible thing he said about the president’s conversation,” well it was a fraud. I didn’t say that. And by the way, you have the whistle blower. Where’s the informer? And here’s another question. Remember before I gave the transcript, in other words, before I revealed the real conversation, where’s the second whistleblower? Remember the second whistle … wait, wait, wait, wait. There was going to be a second whistleblower. But after I gave the conversation, he just went away. He miraculously went away. Where’s the informer? Because there was going to be this informer … Maybe Schiff was the informant. You ever think of that? He’s a corrupt guy, he’s a corrupt politician.
<44:41>
So listen, I say this. Where’s the informer? Remember, the informer was coming forward. Because, see, I did one that surprised everybody. This gentleman right here said, “Boy, that was a shocker.” I revealed the conversation. I got approval from Ukraine, because I didn’t want to do it without their approval. And they said, “Absolutely, you did nothing wrong.” By the way, president of Ukraine, Foreign Minister said, “He did nothing wrong.” And over that, with 196 to nothing vote by the Republicans, not one dissenting Republican vote, dishonest Democrats impeached a president of the United States. That man is a disgrace to IGs. All right, let’s go, next. Please? <crosstalk 00:45:24> He was a total disgrace.
<45:32>
We’ll get off this because people want to talk about what we’re talking about. But let me just tell you something. That’s my decision. I have the absolute right. Even the fake news last night said, “He has the absolute right to do it.” But ask him, “Why didn’t you go and see the actual conversation?” There was no rush. He said, “Oh, we have to rush it.” He even said it was politically biased. He actually said. The report could have been, you know who the whistle blower is, and so do you, and so does everybody in this room, and so do I. Everybody knows, but they give this whistleblower status that he doesn’t deserve. He’s a fake whistleblower. And frankly, somebody ought to sue his ass off. All right, that’s enough of the whistleblower. Go ahead, please?
<46:22>
What he didn’t say is … okay, let me tell you what he didn’t say. Two very good friends of mine brought him those ventilators. Two very good friends of mine, they brought them. If you’d like their name, I’ll give you their name. <crosstalk 00:46:40> No, but the governor didn’t mention that it came through the Chinese, the country of China, but they were given by two friends of mine. But he didn’t tell you that.
<46:50>
Now the governor also … you’ll see when you read the letter. The governor also asked for 40,000, he wanted 40,000 ventilators. Now the governor, as you know, had a chance to get 16,000 a few years ago. He decided not to get that. The state of New York has asked for help. I’ve given him four hospitals, four medical centers, then I gave him an additional hospital, then I gave a military people to operate the hospital. They were not supposed to be COVID hospitals. Interesting thing happened with the ship. People aren’t in accidents because there’s nobody driving. There’s nobody taking motorcycle rides down the West Side Highway at a hundred miles an hour. People are away so people aren’t being injured. Now they’re asking whether or not we could open up the ship for COVID.
<47:39>
We have given the governor of New York more than anybody has ever been given in a long time, I’ll just say. I was going to say in history, but in a long time. And I think he’s happy. But I think that, because I watched what he said today, and it was fine. I wouldn’t say gracious, it wasn’t gracious, it was okay. I must tell you, Gavin Newsome has been gracious, Los Angeles, California, the job we’ve done, and all of California.
<48:08>
It doesn’t matter, but I think when we’ve given as much as we’ve given to New York, somebody should say, “Nice.” I’ll tell you who has been very nice: Mayor de Blasio has been very nice. He understands what we’ve given him. We brought him some more ventilators to yesterday. But nobody has been given like New York. And I know he appreciates it, he just can’t quite get the words out. But that’s okay.
<48:36>
Yes, go ahead?
<48:40>
To which one?
<48:58>
Well, doctor, I think maybe you should answer that, right? Dr. Birx, please. <crosstalk 00:49:02> Yeah, sure, go ahead.
<52:57>
Before I do that, we had breaking news last night, you know that, you saw that, where I think the probable presidential candidate for the Democrats will be Joe Biden, and he agreed that I was correct when I stopped people from China very early, very, very early from coming into our country. And Dr. Fauci said that was a very big moment because it would be a much different picture we have right now had we allowed thousands and thousands of people from a specific area, I don’t have to go into it, from China, to come in highly infected. It would’ve been a very different thing.
<53:32>
So I appreciate the fact that he did, because I was called xenophobic, racist, I was called many things when I did that very early. And I got a lot of credit for it in The Federalist because The Federalist covered the whole journey. And they said, “Trump was,” … I didn’t speak to the author, respected author. They said, “Trump was right at every single move, and on top of that, he was going through a fake impeachment, a hoax.” I was going through a hoax when I made the decision. And that does take a little time, and certainly a little-
<54:03>
… When I made the decision and that does take a little time and certainly a little thinking time, but I appreciated the fact that Joe Biden announced last night that he now agrees that I was correct. You saw the report come out that I was correct when I stopped people from China coming in at a very early date.
<54:23>
Which one? What?
<54:42>
Yeah.
<54:44>
Well, I don’t know much about it. I can only tell you this. Here we have one of the greatest ships in the world, nuclear aircraft carrier, incredible ship with thousands and thousands of people. And you had about 120 that were infected.
<54:59>
Now, I guess the captain stopped in Vietnam and people got off in Vietnam. Perhaps you don’t do that in the middle of a pandemic or something that looked like it was going to be. History would say you don’t necessarily stop and let your sailors get off, number one. But more importantly, he wrote a letter. The letter was a five-page letter from a captain, and the letter was all over the place. That’s not appropriate. I don’t think that’s appropriate. And these are tough people. These are tough, strong people. I thought it looked terrible, to be honest with you.
<55:31>
Now they made their decision. I didn’t make the decision. Secretary of Defense was involved and a lot of people were involved. I thought it was terrible what he did, to write a letter? I mean, this isn’t a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that’s nuclear powered, and he shouldn’t be talking that way in a letter. He could call and ask and suggest. But he stopped in Vietnam. A lot of people got off the boat. They came back and they had infection. And I thought it was inappropriate for the captain of a ship to do.
<56:05>
I don’t want to comment as to whether or not, but I agree with their decision 100%.
<56:09>
In the back, please.
<56:16>
He just what?
<56:17>
Oh, he didn’t write anything. Look, he has people, he has professionals from the Democrats writing.
<56:32>
He didn’t write that. That was done by a Democrat operative. He doesn’t write. He’s probably not even watching right now. And if he is, he doesn’t understand what he’s watching. But just so you understand, it was very nice what they wrote. I don’t know. You know, they released it in a strange time. It’s sort of a strange time to release something like that. But he admitted I was right.
<56:54>
And if you read the Federalist story, which most of you won’t because you don’t want to, but you’d learn something because it goes to a chart, times. I was early. Dr. Fauci, I don’t think he’s changed his mind, but he said it was a very important step when we stopped China from coming in from the specific area that was heavily infected. We’d have a whole different thing right now, so I don’t really know what Joe Biden said. I don’t really care.
<57:21>
And again, I see every once in a while I’ll say something, I’ll make a speech and then it’ll be critiqued and I’ll get this beautiful, brilliant critique. Joe Biden didn’t write that. Joe Biden didn’t write that. He wished he did, but he didn’t.
<57:35>
Go ahead. Please, back.
<01:00:20>
All right, Jeff, got it?
<01:00:38>
We’re very disappointed in 3M. They should be taking care of our country, and they can sell to others, but they should be taking care of our country. The people that have dealt with them have dealt successfully with many companies over the last month. They don’t like the way 3M has treated our country. They don’t frankly like the representatives of 3M and no act of … You said piracy, right? Piracy?
<01:01:07>
There’s been no act of piracy. No, there’s been no act of piracy. It’s the opposite. 3M has not treated our country well, and if they do, great, and if they don’t, they’re going to have a hell of a price to pay.
<01:01:18>
Okay. I say it that way, and I watched him on television on something talking about how this is so hard to believe, so hard to fathom. They ought to get their act together because I got involved and I looked at what happened and 3M has not treated our country well.
<01:01:37>
Go ahead, please.
<01:01:40>
We’ll get you the information.
<01:02:24>
And I hope they use the hydroxychloroquine, and they can also do it with Z-Pak subject to your doctor’s approval and all of that. But I hope they use it because, I’ll tell you what, what do you have to lose? In some cases they’re in bad shape. What do you have to lose? It’s been out there for a long time and I hope they use it and they’re going to look at the … With doctors, work with doctors, get what you have to get.
<01:02:50>
But we have it stockpiled and we have a lot of it and we’re getting more of it. And as I told you, I spoke to Prime Minister Modi. We’re getting more of it, but we have a lot of it and I hope they use it because it’s been used for a long time and therefore it’s passed the safety test. FDA has been terrific. Dr Hahn, I appreciate it very much, too.
<01:03:11>
But I’ve seen some results now. It’s early, I guess. It’s early, and they should look at the lupus thing. I don’t know what it says, but there’s a rumor out there that, because it takes care of lupus very effectively as I understand it. It’s a drug that’s used for lupus.
<01:03:27>
So there’s a study out there that says people that have lupus haven’t been catching this virus. No. Maybe it’s true. Maybe it’s not. Why don’t you investigate that?
<01:03:36>
And there’s also other studies with the malaria that the malaria countries have very little people that take this drug for malaria, which is very effective for malaria, that those countries have very little of this virus. I don’t know. You’re going to check it out. But I think people should … If it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway. I may take it. Okay. I may take it, and I’ll have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it.
<01:04:05>
Yeah, please go ahead.
<01:04:18>
OPEC can do whatever. Look, I’ve been against OPEC all my life because what is it? It’s an illegal, you could call it a cartel, you could call it a monopoly. You got a lot of different names for it, but it broke down very violently, very violently. So I don’t care about OPEC. I really don’t. I couldn’t care less about OPEC.
<01:04:37>
Let me just say it. No, no. I think they’re going to settle it. You know why? Because they’re going to be destroyed. They’re destroying themselves if they don’t. Russia, it’s a very important, and we had a very good conversation, President Putin and myself, very good, but Russia, a big part of their economic wellbeing is from oil. Well, oil is at a record low. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. It’s actually lower than you even think and it’s to their advantage. Obviously it’s to Saudi Arabia’s advantage.
<01:05:06>
They told me they are discussing. Saudi Arabia went much further than that. He thinks that a deal is going to be made at 10 million barrels reduction and maybe more than that. He actually indicated it would most likely be much more than that.
<01:05:21>
So we’ll see what happens. I mean we’re going to see what happens, but as far as OPEC is concerned, I was against OPEC for years and years be.
<01:05:28>
cause I thought it was very unfair to our country. The beautiful thing is we have built one of the great … One of the things we’ve done is created so much we produce. We’re the number one producer in the world right now. I don’t like it for a different reason because it’s going to hurt a lot of jobs in our country, this price. It’s going to hurt a lot of jobs.
<01:05:47>
Now, with all of that being said, people are going to be driving, paying 90 cents a gallon. Did you hear that? What’s that, 1952 or something? All right, so from that standpoint …
<01:05:58>
But you know what? I am a big believer in our great energy business, and we’re going to take care of our energy business, and if I have to do tariffs on oil coming from outside, or if I have to do something to protect thousands and tens of thousands of energy workers and our great companies that produce all these jobs, I’ll do whatever I have to do. Okay?
<01:06:18>
Yeah ma’am, go ahead. Yeah.
<01:06:35>
Well, he’s a good athlete and he loves soccer and he’s like everyone else. Everything’s shut down. He’s in his room. He’s happy, but he’s not as happy as he could be. He’d like to be playing sports, Barron, and let’s see what happens.
<01:06:53>
But we have to get back. We have to get back. Remember that. We have to get back and we have to get back soon. Okay.
<01:07:03>
You guys ever stop? You want to keep going for a little while, huh? I mean, do you ever stop? How many times you ask, and in many cases it’s the same. Actually, a lot of good questions. Go ahead, but keep going. Yes.
<01:07:15>
So you’re not going to blame me that I kept it going too long. People said, “Oh, he kept …” every time you’ll ask it. No, I mean, no, it’s amazing. Every hand went up. I thought we’ve gone through … I think every single hand went up the last time. You know what it shows you? It shows you that you love what you do. Go ahead.
<01:07:34>
You do. No, you do, and some of you do it well. Not all of you. Go ahead. I’m not looking at you, by the way.
<01:08:01>
Look, the job numbers are what they are. We asked everybody to go home, don’t work. So the numbers are going to be astronomical. We understand that. I understood that. I know somebody said the numbers are meaningless and then they took that to mean obs don’t mean anything. And it was just another fake news story.
<01:08:22>
It wasn’t me that said it, by the way. It was a very smart person, but they meant it by saying it really is what … That’s why I answer your question very carefully. The numbers are what they are. We know the numbers were going to be massive because we told everybody to go home and lock your door essentially, right? Don’t come to work. You can’t come to work. Don’t go outside, don’t breathe, don’t do anything.
<01:08:44>
We got to open up our country, but I know, I know that it’s coming back, and in my opinion, it will come back very strong. There’s a tremendous energy, there’s a tremendous demand and, some good things have happened. I don’t know.
<01:08:59>
There’s one habit that, as you know, most of you, a lot of you have covered me a long time before I did this, I was never a big believer in shaking hands. But I decided if you don’t shake hands, you’re not going to be winning a lot of contests. Right now, I’m not sure you have to shake hands anymore. A couple of people have told me, Debra, you told me, that if we didn’t shake hands, the incidence of flu, flu is a big deal also, and that flu might be cut down in half. Who knew that shaking hands was such a bad thing?
<01:09:28>
I felt it. I always felt it and I was never to a point where I can’t shake somebody’s hand. And I knew people like that, too, but there weren’t too many of them. But when I ran for office, all of a sudden I’m shaking hundreds of hands, and if I don’t, I wouldn’t even be standing here.
<01:09:43>
But I think that’s a custom that maybe people don’t have to. We have to get close together. We have to sit together at the stadiums, we have to sit next to each other and wrestle. All that stuff is going to happen. But I think the concept of shaking hands may be something that’s going to be a little bit from the past. Let’s see what happens. Maybe they’ll go right back to shaking hands.
<01:10:03>
Good.
<01:10:14>
Well, we’ve seen a lot of that yet. You might say something. I have seen such support. I saw this morning where everyone’s, they’re clapping for fire department, they’re clapping for peace, but they are really, these people are …
<01:10:25>
You know what they’re like? Tony, they’re like warriors. Mike, they’re like warriors. They were going in Elmhurst hospital, which has been tragic. Right near where I grew up in Queens, going in. And the people in buildings, they’re going … They’re the rock stars. They’re warriors. Nurses, doctors, first responders, what they’re going through.
<01:10:50>
And they don’t even know what’s going to happen. They go in and, by the way, even if they have great equipment, they’re catching it. They have good equipment, they catch it. They catch it with good, with bad. It is evil. But, Tony, you might say something, and, Mike, you may say something about that. Yeah.
<01:12:30>
Pretty much what’s happening. Mike? Please.
<01:14:40>
Mike, thank you.
<01:14:41>
And think also about the Army Corps of Engineers. It’s a little different depending on where are and where they’re working, but the Army Corps of Engineers throwing up a hospital in New York City, 2,500 beds in three days. I mean think of that.
<01:14:56>
And FEMA, what they’re doing, and the National Guard is now delivering for the states because the states were unable to get, we’d drop it at a big warehouse where we’re told to drop it, and some of the states were unable to bring it from the warehouse to the site. So we got the National Guard to become a delivery service if you can believe it, and they would bring it. And some of those sites were dangerous sites. They were very dangerous sites. Think of that.
<01:15:23>
It’s been amazing. It’s been amazing. I just think I’ve never seen anything like it. I’m so proud of this country. And really it’s a world problem, and some countries in the world are just handling it so well. You know, again, I keep saying it’s 151. That was as of two or three days ago. It’s probably more. Some people said they didn’t know there were that many countries. That’s how big this is.
<01:15:46>
And Mike said something else. So the Palm Sunday, tomorrow, think of it, we’re not going to churches on Palm Sunday, but think of next Sunday, Easter. And I brought it up before. I said, ” Maybe we could allow special for churches. Maybe we could talk about it. Maybe we could allow them with great separation outside on Easter Sunday.” I don’t know. It’s something we we should talk about. But somebody did say that, well, then you’re sort of opening it up to that little, do we want to take a chance on doing that when we’ve been doing so well. But Easter Sunday, Palm Sunday, I’m going to be watching tomorrow live from Riverside, California, great church, but I’m going to be watching on a computer, right on a laptop. I think on Easter, maybe I’ll be watching from a laptop as opposed …
<01:16:43>
So how sad is it that we have Easter Palm and Easter Sunday and people are watching on laptops and computers? It’s sad, but the job that this whole country has done is amazing.
<01:16:59>
But I’ll say this. Our medical professionals, what they’ve done, because they walk into those hospitals, you see them putting on their gear and they’re putting it on as they’re walking through the front doors. And some of those people are going to die. They’re going to die. You know, it’s like incredible.
<01:17:17>
And we can say what we want, Tony and Deb, about young and medium aged. Plenty of those people dying, too. You know, it generally hits the older people where they have problems. It hits young people, too, and it hits middle aged people, too.
<01:17:34>
But these people are walking into hospitals and I watch. I think it’s incredible. And they’re putting their outfit, they’re getting into it, and they’re going in. They go in. It’s like a war.
<01:17:49>
Again, there’s never been anything so contagious as this. In 1917, it was vicious if you got it, but it wasn’t contagious like this. Now in 1917, had they had the internet and all the means of communication, they could have practiced distancing. You know, by the time people started thinking in terms in those terms, they lost, I guess, 75 to 100 million people. So that’s modern day. Great thing that happened.
<01:18:18>
Please.
<01:18:29>
Well, I don’t know. I’d rather leave that to the doctor. Doctor, do you have an answer to that?
<01:20:46>
And mitigation does work. But, again, we’re not going to destroy our country. We have to get back because at a certain point, you’ll lose more people this way, through all of the problems caused, than you will-
<01:21:03>
This way through all of the problems caused, then you will with what we’re doing right now… What we’re doing right now, I think it’s going to be very successful. But you know what? I don’t know. We have a big decision to make at a certain point. Okay? We have a big decision to make. We went this extra period of time, but I said it from the beginning. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and we cannot let that happen. We have an incredible country. We were having the greatest period in our country’s history from an economic standpoint in many other ways. We cannot let this continue. So at a certain point some hard decisions are going to have to be made. Go ahead.
<01:21:49>
That’s true.
<01:22:05>
Could be. I mean, it could be you have shortages, and it could also be that you have some that have way overestimated the number of ventilators they need. We think that we have a good amount ready to move. I mean, literally, like an army, they’re ready to move to any hotspot. But some of the ones that you’re talking about, always a nasty question from CNN.
<01:22:29>
Because I think that frankly <crosstalk 01:22:31> because you know what you’ve asked that question about 10 times over the course of about a month. Look, we’re mobilized and ready to go. We have a lot of ventilators ready to go, and if we had given them all out, we wouldn’t, and you would be overstocked in many areas. What we’re doing is we have a very good plan to take from some areas. Even though we have the 10 or almost the 10,000, we’re also taking from areas that won’t be as badly hit as today we think they will be. There will be some areas hit harder than we think, and there’s nothing that Deborah or Tony or any of these professionals can do about it.
<01:23:08>
This thing moves in a lot of ways, but what we’re going to do is we are going to have, and you look at us compared to a lot of other countries, we’re in much better shape. But these professionals have done an amazing job. Now, over the next week and two weeks, it’s going to be a very, very deadly period, unfortunately. But we’re going to make it so that we lose as few lives as possible, and I think we’re going to be successful. I think we already are successful in that regard. When you look at that graph and you see all of the bumps, if you want to call it, at a very low level, and you see a couple at a higher level, they were tough, but you see all of those levels.
<01:23:50>
You know when you look at and when you hear about Italy and then you hear about France and then you hear about… What we have is we have many Italy’s all over. They’re like countries. California is a country, New York is a country. If you look at them from the standpoint of what we’re talking about. We have many like country spots. Some are hotspots, and there’s nothing we’re going to do about it. One of the biggest surprises is Louisiana because it started off so good, and then all of a sudden it shot up like a rocket, but we are going to try and have ventilators wherever we possibly can. Jeff, go ahead.
<01:24:29>
Sure.
<01:24:30>
Well, New York wanted 40,000 ventilators. Okay, 40,000. Think of what 40,000 is? It’s like cars. It’s a big project. It’s an expensive product. I mean, some of them a $50,000 a piece. I saw one the other day, 55,000, that was before they start playing the games with supply and demand okay? Some are very, very, you call them luxury. Some are not. But frankly these are very expensive products. These are very high tech projects and products, and they take a period of time.
<01:25:00>
We have thousands of them being built right now. Some will be ready, and we’re going to have extra, and we’ll keep them at hospitals. But a lot of hospitals, a lot of states had the chance of getting ventilators, and they turned those ventilators down so they could spend their money at something else. In a way I understand that, because who thinks a thing like this? It’s not a knock. If I’m told, perhaps in New York, you can spend one billion dollars on ventilators and get 16,000 or a massive number of ventilators that they’ve been offered over the years. Or you can build a new bridge or road or something. I mean, I understand how that works. I’m not blaming anybody. I’m just saying a lot of the States had chances of stockpiling a lot of ventilators. They didn’t do it, and I think we’re doing a very good job in helping them out place. Please, Jeff. It’s a very fair question. I understand that question very well. Yeah.
<01:26:02>
I’d like to ask also, yeah. I’d like to say we know pretty much the line of attack. We know the numbers. The numbers are the numbers. They seem to be checking out, unfortunately. Or in some cases they’re on the low side, which we’re very happy. We want to keep them on the very low side, and that’s where we’re headed. I think that’s maybe where we’re headed. But I’d like to ask maybe you and Tony, where is the week or the number of days of greatest attack? What will be our worst day, if that’s possible to determine? I think that’s what you’re asking, right?
<01:30:56>
Go ahead. <inaudible 01:30:57>.
<01:31:52>
One of the reasons that I keep talking about hydroxychloroquine is that the question that nobody ever asks, and the question that I most hate the answer to is what happens if you do have a ventilator? What are your chances? I just hope that hydroxychloroquine wins. Coupled with perhaps the Z pack, as we call it, dependent totally on your doctors, and the doctors there.
<01:32:27>
Because you know the answer to that question. If you do have the ventilator, you know the answer to that question. I hate giving the answer, so I don’t want to get them there. I don’t want to get them there. There’s a possibility, a possibility, and I say it. What do you have to lose? I’ll say it again. What do you have to lose? Take it. I really think they should take it, but it’s their choice, and it’s their doctor’s choice or the doctors in the hospital. But hydroxychloroquine. Try it, if you’d like.

The other thing, if you have a heart condition, I understand probably you stay away from the Z pack. But that’s an antibiotic. It can clean out the lungs. The lungs are a point of attack for this horrible virus. But when you have a ventilator, don’t ask the answer because I hate it if you have it and it’s working beautifully. I don’t like the answer because it’s not a very high percentage. So I want to keep them out of ventilators. If this drug works, it will be, not a game changer, because that’s not a nice enough term. It will be wonderful. It’ll be so beautiful. It’ll be a gift from heaven if it works. Because when people go into those ventilators, you know the answers. I know the answers, and I’m glad you don’t write about it. Mike, please.

We’re way ahead of schedules. The banks have been great. JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, they are so far ahead. This is typical with you in particular. We hear their behind. They’re not behind. It been flawless so far, far beyond our expectations. You should say, I hear you’re doing well, but maybe… I don’t even hear of any glitch. They’ve done billions of dollars of loans to small business. These are great loans. These are loans that get immediately paid off. These are loans that get businesses back. I wish you could ask a question where something’s working so well. Now maybe things won’t work well, and I don’t mind that kind. But when something’s working so well and you ask a question in such a negative way. It’s doing great. Yeah, go ahead. <crosstalk 01:41:01>. It’s doing great. Really good. Maybe it won’t in two weeks, and I’ll respond differently, but it’s doing great. You know it and so does everyone else. Everyone’s shocked how well it’s doing.
<01:41:12>
<crosstalk 01:41:12> Who did?
<01:41:13>
Yes.
<01:41:34>
I don’t think it’s changed much, has it?
<01:41:38>
Same pattern. Same answer that we’ve given you for the last month.
<01:41:54>
We can bring an updated graph, but it’s very similar. Please.
<01:42:03>
We’re looking at it very seriously. Right now we’re dealing with governors, we’re dealing with airlines, we’re dealing with a lot of different factors. It’s a very difficult decision. We’re also doing testing, getting into planes, very strong testing. States are doing testing of people that leave planes because they don’t want to have people coming in who are infected. So understanding that and the level of testing has been enormous. Okay? Some states are saying you have to go in quarantine for two weeks if you come from certain areas. So knowing that, we’re working with the governors.
<01:42:42>
Both. Some states are doing when they land, they are doing very strong, very powerful testing. Please go ahead.
<01:42:49>
Okay, well, then you’ll check up again.
<01:42:53>
Governments are doing it too. Our government.go ahead.

Know Jack Ma, is a friend of mine. He’s made it very possible to get about a thousand ventilators from China. But that was from him and my other friend. That was really a gift, and we appreciate it very much. It was very nice of them. All right. I think we’ve had enough. We’ll be seeing you very soon, and I’m sure that you know that all of us are going to be working very hard. We’re working very hard. We are really coming up into a time that’s going to be very horrendous. Probably a time like we haven’t seen in this country, wouldn’t you say? I mean, I don’t think we’ve seen a time like this in the country, and we’re getting to that point where it’s going to really be a some very bad numbers. We want to keep those numbers a lot lower than they would have been, and we will do that.
<01:43:58>
We have tremendous talent working. We have tremendous people, and that includes governors. That includes everybody. Everybody’s working, but unfortunately we’re getting to that time when the numbers are going to peak, and it’s not going to be a good looking situation. I really believe we probably have never seen anything like these kinds of numbers. Maybe during the war, during a world war one or two or something. But this is a war all in to itself, and it’s a terrible thing. We will be seeing you soon. We’ll keep you totally abreast. We’re also going to be releasing new ventilator numbers because we have a lot of them coming, and a lot of them going to different locations, and we appreciate it very much. Thank you. Thank you.
