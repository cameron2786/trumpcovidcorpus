Two simple questions for you Mr. President.

Thank you very much. <crosstalk 00:47:28> Thank you very much. Mr president, you already talked. Mr. President the other day you said that you were not responsible for the testing shortfall. Very simple question. Does the buck stop with you? And on a scale of one to 10 how would you rate your response to this crisis?
