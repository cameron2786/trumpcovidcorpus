Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. Thank you for your time. I’m the CEO of Wyndham Destinations, and we are in the vacation ownership and exchange business, the world’s largest company in that space. We employ 23,000 associates, and take care of over five million households on vacation every year. Largely in the industry, it’s about an $80 billion impact to the overall economy, and we employ directly 250,000, and another 250,000 through other small businesses that work well with our industry. To your point about a quick recovery, we purely serve a leisure customer, which means just like after 9/11, just after the ’08, ’09, our customers will be back really quick, as soon as we’re on the other side. We really believe our industry will recover quickly-

And be an accelerant back to the economy once we get to the other side.
