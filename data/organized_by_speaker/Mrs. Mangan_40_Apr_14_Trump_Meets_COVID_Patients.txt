Well, not as bad as some of these, but definitely with that shortness of breath, which actually came later, which is another thing that’s interesting.
<19:09>
It is. The first few days, I just had a really bad headache and fever … low fever, 100.4, enough to make you feel bad … and the chills and the aches. That lasted about five, six days, and then I thought I was … I was telling people, “I’m fine. It was just kind of like a bad flu. It was not that big a deal.” Still in quarantine and everything, but it was the second week that then the respiratory hit.
<19:37>
Oh yeah. I told people, “I’m 100%.” I mean, not released, but felt strong enough, and then was hit hard, I think it was that next Wednesday. Then the shortness of breath, and I also got a pulse ox, which did make me feel better. But just, it came in waves. I mean, I had three probably different waves and tested positive again after a month, and I am negative now. But it’s—
<20:07>
Over a month.
<20:08>
We were positive on the 12th—
<20:15>
Yeah, the first symptoms were the 9th, and I didn’t test negative until five days ago.
<20:24>
I’m great.
<20:26>
I would say 85%.
<21:36>
Absolutely. I think I’m a little scared to say 100% because I think I said that before and then took a dive, so … I’m good.
