Thank you very much Mr. President. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you and your team on the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve Program. This will provide a really important mechanism for us in serving our patients and communities by ensuring that this vital equipment will be available to critical areas that are in need. As this battle against this disease has affected the country a little bit unevenly, the rates of infection, hospitalization and ICU use varies from one region to another. In some places with lower infection rates some ventilators may not be in use while other areas are potentially stretched beyond their capacity. The database of available ventilators that we are creating will allow us to flex so that we can make sure that available equipment can be shared with those in need.

We appreciate the leadership of the health systems that are here today that has stepped forward and Adam mentioned a few, I don’t know if he caught Dr. Fritz Francoise from NYU Langone and David Dill, the CEO of LifePoint as well. We appreciate the work of the administration in helping us find innovative solutions to ensure the best care for our patients. We’ll continue to work with hospitals and health systems across the country to add to this reserve further. Your team has provided us with important leadership and we look forward to working with you in making this a success. Thank you Mr. President.
