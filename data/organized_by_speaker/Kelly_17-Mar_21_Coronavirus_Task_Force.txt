Mr. President, on your Defense Production Act power, one of the features of that is that the federal government would be able to control the output, whether it’s masks or ventilators, get it to the most areas of need and control the pricing to keep it at a market level so it’s not price gouging. One of the things we’re hearing from governors, they can’t find supplies and prices have gone up. So you’ve talked about the act, sir, but you have not yet compelled any companies. Why not?
<42:04>
How do you direct them to the places in greatest need?
<42:27>
This happens, <crosstalk 00:42:28> need equipment today.

Mr President, Mr. President …
<59:16>
On the economic front, there are reports that the coronavirus is really hurting your businesses, especially your hotels.
<59:24>
Yeah, so is that true? And can you speak to financials?
<59:58>
And did you or anyone in your administration talk to anyone at the Trump organization about the potential effects of the coronavirus?
<01:00:24>
Will you no longer go to Mar-a-Lago?
<01:16:53>
Admiral, we’re using your numbers-
<01:16:55>
-trying to find out for the public if the things you’ve promised are happening.
<01:17:05>
And are the masks that are in the strategic reserve being deployed Mr. Vice President?
<01:17:13>
So it’s not 13000 anymore. It would be a lower number. Would that be fair to say?
<01:17:18>
No, the ventilators. I’m sorry, the respirators.
<01:17:24>
We’re trying to understand if the things we have been told sitting through these briefings for many days are happening and getting into the hands of the healthcare providers.
<01:17:37>
We’re trying to get an answer.
<01:18:18>
Thank you, Mr. President.
<01:29:44>
Thank you, sir.
<01:29:44>
Sorry for your loss, referring to our colleague.
