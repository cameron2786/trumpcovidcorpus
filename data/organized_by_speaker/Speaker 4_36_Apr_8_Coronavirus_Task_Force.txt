Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. Secretary, I have a question. The World Health Organization has a fundraising drive for $700 million for coronavirus resources. China has only donated 20 million. The United States actually has donated less. Do you feel that China should be giving more to this World Health Organization effort? And comments on the U.S. donation?
