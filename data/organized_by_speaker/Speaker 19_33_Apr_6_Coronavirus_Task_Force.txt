<crosstalk 01:09:38> Dr. Birx, to clarify something that she said on Saturday, sir.

May I ask Dr. Birx to clarify something that she said on Saturday? If I may, Dr. Birx, this is a question that comes from a radio colleague of mine, Tamara Keith, and on Saturday it sounded like you said that for the next week people in high risk areas should not even go to the market or the drug store. Is that what you meant to say or is that accurate?
