Some assistance with it. So, Mr. President already addressed most of this, but we named our campaign frontline fuel. We raised over $6,000, helped over 18 local businesses, and delivered meals to nurses and doctors in the area, over 500 nurses and doctors. We also partnered with a local boutique company that produces hand sanitizer, defy ascetic, to include in our drop-offs as an added bonus. Our mission is simple. We want to help local business while also encouraging and helping healthcare workers who are selflessly working around the clock to ensure the health of our people. Thank you, Mr. President for this opportunity. It’s an honor to be here today.
