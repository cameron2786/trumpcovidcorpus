Thank you, Mr. President. The exact same time that we learn what we did about General Flynn, the exact same time we learned that there was absolutely no basis for the entire Mueller, Russia investigation that the FBI did, that very time Nancy Pelosi sets up a select committee to come after you again. And so we just need to understand guys that they’re never going to stop. But in spite of that relentless attack we’ve seen from them, Mr. President, we appreciate your leadership. We appreciate your entire team’s leadership, getting things done for the American people. And I think as Dan said, I appreciate your work ethic. I know how hard you work for the American people. I mean, I know how hard Meadows … he used to return my calls all the time. Now I know he’s working 15 hours, 18 hours a day-

… and you’re working even more. So thank you for doing all that, the people in the fourth district of Ohio appreciate it. The people around the country appreciate it and we just need to keep it up and we’ll have the great American comeback happening real soon.
