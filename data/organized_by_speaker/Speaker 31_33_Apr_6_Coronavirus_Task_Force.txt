Mr. Vice President, for whoever wants to answer this. It’s a technical question. FEMA says that it is in the process of distributing 90% of each states allocated supplies from the National Strategic Stockpile and that allocation is determined based on population by the last census in each state and the other 10% it says is going to frontline healthcare workers serving in the federal response efforts. Where are those healthcare workers in the federal response and do you envision a scenario in which you could start giving states more supplies from the National Strategic Stockpile?

And if I could just follow up on that very quickly then, is it even worth then governors writing into FEMA, if they’ve already received their 90% allocation and you’re getting data directly from the hospitals to ask for more at this point?

Thank you, sir.
