Can I just follow up on the testing question real quick before we move on. So, so the testing numbers, I understand a million tests done is a big increase, but we were told there would be a 27 million tests available by the end of the month. So can you outline where in the supply chain, where in the logistics chain, where are the other 26 million tests right now?

So they’re the 26 million tests we were talking about. Were those tests under the old antiquated system?

So are we still even using those 27 million tests or have we just completely moved on to the point of care tests?
