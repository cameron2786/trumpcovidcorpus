Mr. President, what funding are you considering withdrawing from Michigan?
<29:33>
From Michigan. You threatened to keep funding away from the state of Michigan. Which funding were you referring to?
<31:58>
Just a follow up on that, sir. Are you concerned about the message that you’re sending of saying, you may withhold funding from Michigan when it’s also going through these issues with the Water and the dam breaking?
