Was it appropriate for the President to call your department a deep state department. At a time when thousands of diplomats are working very hard around the world to combat this pandemic?
Sec. Pompeo: <01:06:01>
Worked with the President for three years now. I know how much he values the people that work on my team. I know when I was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, how much he valued the work we did. I know that he watches our team, Dr. Burke’s, all the team that’s working to push back against this virus to keep America safe. I know how much he values them.
