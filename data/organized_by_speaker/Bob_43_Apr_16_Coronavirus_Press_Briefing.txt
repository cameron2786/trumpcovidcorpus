Thank you, Mr president. I think what’s really important is during this bringing people back to work and our economy back to work and what’s going to go back is that we’re going to be very aggressively focused on early case recognition, isolation and contact tracing. In the event that we just went through, unfortunately in as we started, we were very capable of doing that when the initial cases all came from China all the way through January, all the way through to the end of February, we were able to identify cases early. The first 14 do the contacts, do the contact tracing over 800 contacts. We identified that two of those contacts were actually infected. We were able to isolate them. We were able to contain the outbreak. We’re about to enter a new phase of this where we’re going back to containment and mitigation is going to continue as Dr. Birx and others have said.

Some of the things that we’ve learned to do, we’re going to continue, but the major thrust of how we’re going to control and make sure that we continue to keep this nation open is early case recognition, isolation and contact tracing and that’s the fundamentals of public health. That’s what we’re going to do. You see, we have very good surveillance systems that are going to help us as we see these cases sporadically across the country. We’ve got to jump on them with early diagnosis, isolation and contact tracing. That’s what CDC is going to continue to help build that capacity in the states across this nation.
