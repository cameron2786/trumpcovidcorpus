Thank you. Well, you had mentioned the pledge earlier and how we had called upon the private sector to step up and train America’s current and future workforce for the jobs they could see that existed in this country. And we were overwhelmed by the success of that initiative. So this was really born out of the same concept. We are all in this fight together as a country and as a nation. And so we called upon each of you to do more and to assist us in what is a really Herculean effort. So we’re appreciative of what you’ve done, stay safe, stay healthy, stay supportive of one another, and really thank you for doing your part and making these very substantial announcements today.
