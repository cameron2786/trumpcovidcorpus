The extensions on work travel. Can you define that? Is all work trip, anyone with a work visa can still cross the border? Can you define the measures that you’re taking?
Sec. Pompeo: <58:16>
That’s a great question. We’re working with very real concern about H2A visas in particular agriculture workers need to get across. We’re going to make sure that we do everything we can to keep that part of our economic lifeblood working between our two countries. DHS and the state department will work together. We want to make sure and keep commerce between Canada, United States and Mexico alive, functional and prepared for the day that this economy bounces back like we expected that it will.
