Separately, let me ask you about something you said yesterday. You said we should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival.

What did you mean by that?
<19:39>
<Inaudible 00:19:39> considering an executive order to basically ban the export of medical equipment?

When you have this G20 meeting tomorrow, what sort of coordinated response are you expecting?
<36:59>
Next week when the 15 day period ends, what should we expect then? Are you going to extend it for another week or two?
