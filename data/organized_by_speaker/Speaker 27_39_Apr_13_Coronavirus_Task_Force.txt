Do you believe the country, excuse me, should be reopened on May 1?

What is your advice to the president?
<01:22:28>
It’s for the secretary <crosstalk 01:22:28>.
<01:22:30>
Yes sir. For Secretary Mnuchin, I have a question from one of my colleagues who’s not able to be in the room. They’re curious about the SBA rule that prevents small casinos from getting some of this relief. Is that something that you’re taking a look at? Is there going to be a change <crosstalk 01:22:48>?
<01:23:02>
Thanks sir.
<01:23:54>
Thank you sir. We have seen in a number of these relief bills that Democrats and Republicans have been able to push forward different non coronavirus specific funding priorities. Are you trying to keep funding specific to coronavirus and then if there are going to be other additions, for instance a change to labor rules is something that many on the left wanted. Some on the right are wondering if they should also, if you should also be pushing for their preferred add-ons.

You argued that at the time of that the China man was being discussed, that was too disruptive to the global economy. Was that accurate?
