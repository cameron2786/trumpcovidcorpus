Yeah, no, we had a long discussion. We had a particular discussion and I think many people know, I don’t understand the nail salon piece because I’ve never had my nails done, so I couldn’t understand…

It’s true. So I didn’t really understand it. So we talked about not having them in the first opening wave because you can’t really physical distance. And we had that discussion and he agreed and we’ve moved forward together, and I think it’s those kinds of dialogues. And I think what’s really been impressive to me by the governors is how much they know about epidemiology. So they will never be confused in another pandemic, ever again. Because he came with all of his data about, “What county had what. That was a prison, that was…” And believe me, I had all my data with me and he was able to answer every county and what the issue was.

And I think when you look at Houston, when you look at Dallas and you see the ability to really contain and mitigate those epidemics, but the same time contain epidemics and not allow them to spread in the community, this is what we’ve been asking governors to do with the test and using focus testing to really find asymptomatic cases and protect the vulnerable. And the ability to go into prison, to go into meat packing plants, and go into the senior care centers and proactively test is really quite extraordinary. And I think we still remain concerned about asymptomatic spread. And we think that the progress that they’re making on testing in a focused way to protect others is really a way that we can move forward together to protect everyone in the community.

Every state is different. So I don’t want to get in a comparison with the governors because I’ve talked to some incredible governors who are all doing quite a good job.
