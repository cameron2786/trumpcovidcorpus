Mr. President, you tweeted earlier today that now would be a good time to start looking toward if there is a light at the end of the tunnel and work on an infrastructure bill. Again, you suggested it should be $2 trillion, which is twice what the last one was for the proposal released. Are you anticipating that like after the economic crisis of 2008, 2009, America will need to have so called shovel ready jobs ready to go to get people back to work?

Should the hospitals be prepared for that? We’re hearing from some hospitals-
<01:17:13>
-that they’re facing what looks like a medical war zone in some of these places.
<01:18:48>
What about the Hydroxychloroquine? Is there any booming data on these trials?

Can I ask Dr. Fauci a question about a headline that’s been running all day to get his perspective on it? There is a professor from MIT, Dr. Fauci, who suggests that coronavirus can be carried on droplets a distance of 27 feet. Do you buy into that and if that might be the case, does that suggest the current social distancing guidelines may need to be extended?
<01:53:02>
I know people that do that.

Do you have something that could be useful in this particular instance?
<02:09:07>
<inaudible 02:09:08>.
