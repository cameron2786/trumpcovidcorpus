People should be more concerned right now with the flu in this country.

How worried should Americans be about coronavirus?

As there were more cases, and it was clear that it was spreading out of China where it originated, the president took this move that he was widely criticized for by Democrats and even some Republicans at the time, which was he halted a number of flights from China into the US. The idea was to halt the spread of the disease, keep transmissions to a minimum. He was accused of xenophobia. He was accused of making a racist move. At the end of the day, it was probably effective because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus.

His team is on it. They’ve been responsive late at night, early in the morning, and they’ve thus far been doing everything that they can do. And I want to say thank you, and I want to say that I appreciate it.

He returns calls. He reaches out. He’s been proactive. We got that Mercy ship down here in Los Angeles. That was directly because he sent it down here. Two thousand medical units came to the state of California, these FMS, these field medical stations, and that’s been very, very helpful.

The president has been outstanding through all this. The vice president’s been outstanding. Members of the coronavirus task force, very responsive.

We had asked if we could have, New Jersey could have, access to a piece of the beds that are on the USNS Comfort, and the president came back, called a short few minutes before I walked in here to say indeed they would grant that to New Jersey. So that’s a big step for us in addition to all the other capacity. That news is literally hot off the press, and I thank the president and vice president who were on the call together.
Arizona Governor <Video>: <18:02>
President Trump approved Arizona’s requests for presidential major disaster declaration. I want to thank the president for a quick turnaround. We requested this on a Wednesday, and we had approval by Saturday morning. And we are grateful to the administration for their continued support and responsiveness.

Well first of all, I want to thank the president and the vice president for doing a really good job of communicating with all the governors.
