Sure, thank you very much sir and thank you, I’m humbled that you invited me back to pitch in this crisis and honored to be here again with you. I think it’s fitting that the members of Congress, thank you for coming back, that you would be meeting and working to make the economy better precisely today, which was about the worst job support ever. And that was something that we’ve been telling people what’s going to happen because you took the step to save lives, to slow the economy down. But there was a silver lining in the report today, ladies and gentlemen, that was really interesting to us and the President and I talked about last night in the Oval that almost everybody who accounted for the increase in unemployment in the report today said they expect to go back to work within six months.

And now if that happens, then what will have happened is something historic that we would have experienced the biggest shock in the history of the world, just about, short of perhaps world war and recovered quickly. And I think that if we did that, sir, it’s going to be because the economy was so strong in January that people have been able to withstand this. And because the policies that you all worked together to adopt, built a bridge to the other shore. Thank you, sir.
