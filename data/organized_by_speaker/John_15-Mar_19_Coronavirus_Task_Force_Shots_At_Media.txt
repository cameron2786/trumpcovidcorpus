Mr. President, switching to the efforts to boost the economy with the measures before Congress. Will you guarantee that the money, the billions, the tens of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars, even if it’s going to go to these industries will not go to executive bonuses or to more stock buybacks?
<39:26>
You can make it a condition of the bill.
<39:28>
You can say that none of this money can go for that.

Mr. President, if I could, a question for you and then a question for Dr. Hahn. You enabled, I guess is probably the best way to put it, the Defense Production Act yesterday.
<39:49>
But, you didn’t pull the trigger on it.
<39:51>
You’re getting a lot of calls on Capitol Hill from the Democratic leadership to pull the trigger on it. What’s the rationale for not doing that?
<40:52>
Under what conditions would you put the Defense Production Act into action?
<41:09>
For Dr. Hahn.

Dr. Hahn.

Any idea when remdesivir will be available to the market? And are there any drugs in the pipeline that you believe could qualify for a treatment IMD?
<41:48>
Thank you, Dr. Han.

Mr. President, if I could, on China, they reported for the first time since the outbreak no new cases over a 24-hour period. Do you have any reason to disbelieve them? And second to that, the National Security Council yesterday put out a tweet very critical of the Chinese government saying the Chinese Communist Party suppressed initial reports on the Chinese virus and punished doctors and journalists causing Chinese and international experts to miss critical opportunities to prevent a global pandemic. Could you explain that?
<01:10:21>
Forgive me if I missed it, what will the Carnival cruise ships be used for?
<01:10:48>
Are you thinking increased hospital beds?
