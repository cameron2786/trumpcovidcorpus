Thank you. First of all, Senator Paul testing positive. When’s the last time you had in-person contact with him?
<42:54>
Also on top of Senator Paul now, four senators are in isolation and the rules say that in order to vote, they have to be there.
<43:01>
Romney, Senator Lee Gardner, Senator Rick Scott-
<43:06>
Senator Gardner and Senator Rick Scott, also. Two of them were in contact with <crosstalk 00:43:09]-
<43:10>
With the critical stimulus package vote expected soon-
<43:13>
Yes.
<43:18>
Do I detect sarcasm there, sir?
<43:21>
Do you think that Congress should consider changing the rules to allow them to vote remotely if it comes to this critical stimulus package?
<44:27>
It does seem like negotiations still have a ways to go on the stimulus package.
<44:30>
Are you concerned about the timing at all? In the <crosstalk 00:44:32] sense?
