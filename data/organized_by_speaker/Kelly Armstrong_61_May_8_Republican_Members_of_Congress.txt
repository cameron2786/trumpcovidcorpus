Thank you Mr. President. Kelly Armstrong from North Dakota. We’re an Ag and energy state, so we’ve been uniquely hit on a lot of this stuff. But I’d like to say thank you for standing so tough with Saudi Arabia. That was a huge deal for our oil producers. Obviously, you’ve been great for agriculture, but thank you especially for your statement yesterday in support of cattle ranchers. Sometimes they get lost in the mix and they’ve been getting hit pretty hard right now. So we really appreciate that. And then just you get this economy up and going and we’ll do what we do best and that’s feed and fuel the world.
