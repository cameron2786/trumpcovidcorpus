<crosstalk 00:58:45>. Mr. Secretary, the Mexican government has not announced any travel ban on Europe. Have you been in touch with them as to when they’re going to do this and what it is that telling you? And then a second question, they also are telling us and said in a press conference this morning that they will not take back any non Mexican citizen. Any other third parties will have to. We don’t know what will happen to them. So can you address what will happen to those third country immigrants that you are saying that will not be allowed to enter the US and Mexico saying that they will not be allowed to stay in Mexico, either or sent back from the US?
Sec. Pompeo: <59:21>
I’ll take the first one and then Chad, I’ll give you the second one. With respect to travel into Mexico from my side, I spoke with Foreign Minister Ebrard a couple of times about this. I’m very confident we’re going to get to a really good place to protect the Mexican people and the American people from those who might be traveling into places where we’ve got a designation, the <foreign language 00:09:38> zone from China so that they’re not coming into Mexico and then coming into the United States. I’m very confident we’ll do that and we’ll make that announcement shortly together.

But are you sending Guatemalans back to Guatemala? Cubans back to Cuba. What would you do with those third countries that are not Mexicans?
