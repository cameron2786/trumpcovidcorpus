Mr. President, can you say why you’re suing John Bolton to prevent publishing his book?
<57:05>
So what is the DOJ doing…?
<57:26>
Could the Attorney General tell us what the DOJ is doing in terms of the Bolton book?
<57:43>
But the book has been published.
<57:45>
Yes, it’s been published. It’s just not released yet.
<57:57>
So are you going to court to try to stop?
<58:38>
Have you read the book, sir?
