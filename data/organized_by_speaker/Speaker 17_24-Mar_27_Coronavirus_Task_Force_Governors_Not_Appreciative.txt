Mr. President, sir, thank you. Both the World Health Organization as recently as today, and your own health officials have said that any treatments that we use for Coronavirus should be scientifically demonstrated to be effective. But at the same time you’ve said that Chloroquine as an example could be used as a cure very soon. So is WHO and your health officials wrong on this point?
