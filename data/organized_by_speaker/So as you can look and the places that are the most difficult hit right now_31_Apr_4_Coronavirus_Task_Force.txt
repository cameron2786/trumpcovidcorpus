the Detroit area, the New York area, the Louisiana area. We are doing it by the counties in those States because mostly it’s Metro areas and the bedroom communities around those Metro areas.

All of those counties, Wayne and Oakland, they’re all on the upside of their curve of mortality. So you know when you get to the peak you come down the other side.
