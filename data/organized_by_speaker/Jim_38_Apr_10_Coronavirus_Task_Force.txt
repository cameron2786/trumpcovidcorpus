Has anyone under 25 died, Dr. Fauci, in the country?
<01:14:43>
The governor said that no one under 25 has died. I guess you could clarify that people under 25 can die as a result of this.
<01:14:52>
… in the country.
<01:15:05>
If you reopen the country in May and there was a new outbreak, or a spike in infections, are you open to the idea of shutting the country down again?
<01:15:57>
As a second task force?
<01:16:53>
<inaudible 01:16:55>.
<01:17:17>
Bipartisan?
<02:03:37>
And you and some of the officials paint a rosy picture of what is happening around the country. If you look at some of these questions, do we have enough masks? No. Do we have enough tests? No. Do we have enough PPE? No.
<02:03:51>
Do we have enough medical equipment?
<02:03:56>
I’m saying this is-
<02:04:01>
We hear from doctors, we hear from health experts-
<02:04:19>
What do you say to … I mean, you watch the coverage-
<02:04:23>
You’ve been watching a lot of the coverage.
<02:04:24>
No, it’s not.
<02:04:28>
When the doctors and the medical experts come on our air and say-
<02:04:31>
… We don’t have enough tests, we don’t have enough masks.
<02:06:17>
You have doctors or you have hospital administrators-
<02:06:52>
When you’re sanitizing masks, and you’re talking about reusing PPE, obviously you don’t have enough-
