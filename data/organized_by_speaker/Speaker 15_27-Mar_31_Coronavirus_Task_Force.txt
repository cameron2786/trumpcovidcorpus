Thank you, sir. <inaudible 01:05:58> politics. I wanted to ask you about individual states issuing stay at home or what do you think, for instance, in Florida, Ron DeSantis has resisted urges to issue one of those, but he said moments ago that if you and the rest of the task force recommended one, that would weight on him heavily. What sort of circumstances need to be in place for you to make that call and say this is something you should consider?
