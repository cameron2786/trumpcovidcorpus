I want to get back to the virus. You were saying at the beginning of the press conference that you’re looking at holding back 10000 ventilators. Is that because you need to pick and choose where these ventilators are going to have to go because of the nature of the pandemic <crosstalk 01:13:37>-
<01:13:37>
-spreading, and also I just wanted to ask Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx, if it’s possible after you finish, is that part of the reason why you’re projecting 100000 to 200000 deaths? Are there going to be some people who aren’t going to be able to get ventilators or be put on ventilators?
<01:14:47>
<crosstalk 01:14:47> ventilator shortage right now?
<01:26:35>
Yes, sir. This may be an uncomfortable question, but what would the models have looked like that Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci showed us if we had started the social distancing guidelines sooner than February or January when China, South Korea were doing those sorts of <crosstalk 01:26:52>.
<01:26:54>
<crosstalk 01:26:54> reliable, in terms of what information we’re getting from them, but if we had started these practices sooner, could these models be different right now?
<01:29:43>
You understand the painful part of my question, and please, I don’t mean to put you on the spot-
<01:29:50>
-but there may be Americans at home saying, “If we had started this sooner, we might not have 100000 to 200000 Americans dying.”
<01:30:47>
But they were early. They started early. We were watching South Korea, excuse me, and China and Italy, and we weren’t taking action when those countries were spiking.
<01:31:04>
If we had adequate testing, would we have known?
<01:38:27>
What guidance are you offering to Florida when it comes to the two Holland American cruise ships that are seeking to dock here?
<01:45:14>
Going back to your comments about what could have happened and the actions that you took, is there any fairness to the criticism that you may have lulled Americans into a false sense of security when you were saying things like, “It’s going to go away.”
<01:45:28>
And that sort of thing.
<01:45:35>
But hasn’t your thinking on this evolved?
<01:45:39>
Hasn’t your thinking on this evolved? You’re taking it more seriously?
<01:46:44>
<crosstalk 01:46:44> last month and said, “Okay lets go to the beach. Let’s go to the airport, let’s go down to Mardi Gras.”
<01:47:48>
You weren’t just hoping that it would dissipate, that this would disappear?
<01:48:44>
Did you know it was going to be this severe when you were saying this was under control and-
<01:50:27>
You don’t like the question, but are you now taking the-
