Thank you Mr. President and thank you all of you for being here today and what we’d like to talk about is the progress we’ve made. The last time we were here was March 13th and we’ve made tremendous progress and none of that progress could be made without the 47,000 people at Quest Diagnostics that are working around the clock and working up the test and running the test and delivering the results that we need.

As far as results, we’ve made tremendous progress. We are currently at Quest Diagnostics testing and about 50, 000 tests per day. We’ve been pushed by the task force to bring up that number. By the end of May, we’ll have 100,000 tests per day about 3 million tests, and these are the molecular tests that we do today. We’ve also brought up serological testing. We started that this past week and by the end of May we’ll be close to 250,000 a day, about 7,000 a month.

You put those two numbers together it’s about 10 million tests by the end of the May that we’ll be doing at Quest Diagnostics. We’re doing that also in a quicker way. Turnaround times were somewhat of an issue at the early days. We’ve reduced that to one to two days. Our turnaround time for people in beds, hospital beds is less than 24 hours, and we’re doing that in the same way we’ve done it with the FDA and with CLIA delivering the quality that you all expect and convenience will improve as well with convenient solutions that will be able to swab individuals more easily and also deliver to consumer the ability to have consumers choose a test online with the telehealth provider.

With that, I’d like to offer my colleague the podium as well.
