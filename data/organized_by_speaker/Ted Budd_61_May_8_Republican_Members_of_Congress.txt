Ted Budd, North Carolina. Thank you for having me here. I also want to thank my colleagues from the house. There is no vote today. There’s nothing we’re voting on. Speaker Pelosi has not brought us in to do anything meaningful, but we’re here to lead by example and to say that we’re ready to work. So we need something meaningful to help those back home. In North Carolina, we’re very grateful for all the work that you’ve done here. Again, Secretary Mnuchin, want to thank you as well for all that you’ve done. The PPP and the work that you’ve done for Main Street has helped keep these businesses in tact, so that we can have this quick recovery. We’re ready for Q3. We’re ready to get going in North Carolina. We’re ready to rebuild.
