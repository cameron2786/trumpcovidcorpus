Thank you, sir. Sir, I think that you can sense the optimism around the room, that businesses, really a cross section of American businesses collected here are getting back to work, and I think this cross section is extraordinarily representative of what we’re seeing all around America. And as Larry mentioned, as you know, and as you require us, we watch every little detail of the economy every day, and there are now 27 States where more than 75% of the businesses are open. That was almost none a few weeks ago.

And there are 28 States where 80% of the workforce is back to work. And so, the question then becomes, and it’s the last thing I’ll say, that the people in this room are saying yes, but will we have demand for our product? And what we learned today in the personal income report that Larry said is, because you required historic policy action, we got money to people who needed it while they were laid off because of big unemployment insurance checks and because of the $1,200 checks that we mailed people, they have the income now that the economies are starting again to go out and demand product. And so, we’ve very, very bullish on what’s going on with the restart, sir.
