Thank you. Thank you mister president and thanks to a FEMA and HHS. I think great leadership is really working well. The demand has skyrocketed and we’re doing a lot of things to bring in more masks, more other protective apparel. We are involved in reprocessing masks and we’ve already started at about 100,000 masks per day and we hope to expand from there. So we’re quite optimistic about it.
