On the subject of masks, the vice president announced HHS was ordering a hundreds of millions of them. Was that order just placed today? How is that going to be distributed? And when can doctors and nurses expect to actually receive those masks?

We are still hearing from doctors and nurses about the shortage. When exactly can they expect to receive these masks though?

They can expect them today or they’re matching supply and demand?
