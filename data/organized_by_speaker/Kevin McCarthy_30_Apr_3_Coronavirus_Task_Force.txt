Well thank you Mr. President and I would like to thank you. I’m <inaudible 00:00:36>. Governor Newsom says the work that you’re doing together, you’ve been working very closely, has been effective in California. As well, Vice President and the President. You know today, Mr. President, I want to thank you, especially, for the work as Secretary Mnuchin has done especially for small businesses. Just today alone, I saw Bank of America had more than 10,000 loans in two hours. For anybody who’s in small business, my first small business when I was 20 years old, you don’t have income coming in right now. You get a loan. But for your rent, paying your employees, and paying your utilities is a grant. That’s part of the Cares Act. And I think you’re going to find that a lot of small businesses are going to hire people back, keep them afloat through the next two months and get this economy moving again as we get through this virus. So I just want to thank you for all that.
