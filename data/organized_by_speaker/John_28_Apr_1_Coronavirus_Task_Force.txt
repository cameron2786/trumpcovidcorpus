I was just going to say, sir, do you want to move on to solely coronavirus or stick with-

Mr. President, and maybe this is a question as well for Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci, Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted last night, and we checked today that there are still flights that are running between the hotspots like New York and Detroit, New Orleans as well. A number of flights were completed today. Senator Graham’s point is, if you’re going to declare mitigation, should it not be full mitigation, and you stop people from traveling?
<55:58>
But how do you make that calculation as to whether or not you keep the industry going-
<56:01>
Are your risks spreading to change that?
<01:06:19>
Could I ask Dr. Fauci-
<01:06:21>
Because I know he loves being up behind the podium so much.
<01:06:24>
Like pulling teeth but you don’t have the dentist. I don’t want to hit you with everything that’s coming along, but a lot of people who are watching television today heard from a researcher named Dr. Jacob Glanville who’s come up with a potential antibody therapy that he has given to you, <Samrid 00:12:38>. Just wanting to know if you know anything about this, what you might be able to tell people at home about it if you’ve seen it.

There are a lot of people who are worried about getting sick, and do they end up in a hospital? People who are uninsured and will they be crushed by medical bills. You were considering last month, it’s last month already, in March, reopening the healthcare.gov exchanges. There has been a determination not to do that. Could you tell us what the rationale was behind that decision, and what would you have as an alternative?
<01:16:58>
Understood. Mr. Vice President, but there will be people who don’t have insurance who get sick before any of these mitigation efforts are put into place. And without opening the healthcare exchanges, where can they find insurance? People who aren’t insured by these companies that are covering the cost of the copay, where can people go now to get health insurance if they get before they get sick? Before they get sick?
<01:17:52>
Can you expand that to cover middle-class?
<01:18:07>
That’s for people who already have insurance.
<01:20:18>
I mean, just in terms of a fair question or not, I always endeavored to ask fair questions, but this is a huge worry for people in this country who were in that donut hole. They don’t have commercial insurance. They don’t qualify for Medicaid. What do they do?
<01:20:35>
We spent the entire 2000 election talking about the donut hole, and it’s still there.
<01:20:47>
This was 20 years ago when we’re talking about-
<01:20:49>
<crosstalk 01:20:49> the donut hole.
