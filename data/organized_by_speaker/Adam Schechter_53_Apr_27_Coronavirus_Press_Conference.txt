Thank you. Mr. President. Thank you very much for your leadership and for having us all here today. Our scientists and our lab technicians are working day and night in order to do as many tests as we possibly can for the American public and to turn those tests around as quickly as possible. Just 45 days ago we said we could do several thousand tests a day. We can now do 60,000 tests a day and we’re continuing to expand that capacity every single day.

In addition, our scientists are working to make testing more convenient and easier. We have the swabs now that are much smaller than the original ones that we originally launched with, but we also have the Pixel by LabCorp at-home test. That test right now is for healthcare workers on the frontline and first responders, but we will be rolling that out much more broadly over the coming weeks and we’re going to roll it out with absolutely no upfront cost for the individual consumers.

At the same time, we are building our capacity for serology testing and we can currently do about 50,000 today and we’ll be able to do several hundred thousand per day by the middle of May. We’re going to where you’re working with the retailers. Our colleagues are here today to help them as they expand their testing capabilities across the entire country. Lastly, Mr. President, we have a rather large drug development…

And lastly, Mr president, we have a rather large drug development business and we will continue to work with our colleagues and the pharmaceutical and the biotechnology industry to ensure we do everything we possibly can to enroll clinical trials fast so that we can get new treatments and potential vaccines. Thank you.
