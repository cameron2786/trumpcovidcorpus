Mr. President, I was actually speaking to the governor of Iowa before she came to see you. There’s a backlog in terms of live animals, hogs and beef on the hoof out there. How soon will it be before that can get processed? And we are seeing some shortages in meats in many places across the country. How long will it be before the supply chain gets ramped back up again so that we don’t have any shortages?

Another piece of it is as the price for animals and the hoof has gone down, the price of boxed beef has really skyrocketed, and there’s a huge price differential disparity there. Farmers are really hurting, whereas these meat packing plants are making a lot of money. Is there something that the federal government can do? Farmers are asking.
