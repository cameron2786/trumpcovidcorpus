Listening to these two governors, I was governor for a long time. It tells me your approach is the right approach. You’re working with the governors across this country and empowering them to open up as soon as they can safely, based on the conditions in their state and every state’s different. That’s why that approach is so important. Then you providing all that support, along with us in Congress with the Cares Act as well. But you see that now with North Dakota, with Colorado, and across the country. So that’s why it’s so important that you’re doing it the way that you’re doing it with these great governors that we have across the state. So thank you for that.

The other thing I want to mention is for our farmers. You know I work a lot on Ag.

But for our farmers and ranchers, you’ve been there for them and hang in there with them. They’re doing a whale of a job and they’re so important, and our energy industry too.

That’s really important and appreciated. We need to hang in there with them. The only other thing I got to tell you is we have a great governor as you know, but he is so data driven that I was teasing Dr. Birx. Who’s more data driven? These two are amazing.

They’re amazing together. They’re just amazing.
