Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Jim Murren-
<16:37>
The chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts. It’s good to see you all again, Mr. Secretary.
<16:44>
Well, we’re in the spatial recognition world, but I just wanted to say on behalf of MGM, we have made a decision around the country to close our resorts, and tomorrow night we will close all the resorts in Las Vegas. That’s 70,000 people we are now putting on a furlough. I want to retain those employees. I want to bring them back as soon as possible. Las Vegas as you know, will come back rapidly once you give us the green light.
<17:14>
But it’s very important that we keep these people on our payroll just as soon as possible. I also represent the two million jobs of the gaming industry in the United States. And as you know, many of those casinos are in cities that rely upon them for their tax revenue. So I appreciate your efforts, and I stand by to help you in any way I can.
<17:36>
Thank you.
<18:18>
Especially Mr. President, because a lot of us who like Disney voluntarily closed their parks, so they have people out of work today, as does MGM, we have voluntarily closed these resorts. And if we can get some relief on that, we will absolutely want to keep these people on put.

And I’m sorry, one last point. Mr President, on Macau, because Arne Sorenson was talking about it, of course, we own two resorts there. The government shut those casinos down, as you know, for two weeks. We’re starting to slowly see a recovery there, but it is absolutely single digit occupancy right now, so we’re not seeing any better results there currently.
