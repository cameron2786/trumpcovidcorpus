Mr. President, could you comment a little bit on what you’re considering right now for helping the oil and gas industry? <crosstalk 00:06:17>.
<09:34>
Could your secretary of the nation perhaps clarify whether the government is considering taking space and energy companies?
<09:53>
Is that one of the alternatives?
<19:59>
Mr. President, just to follow up on the comments from yesterday, you said you were being sarcastic, but some people may have misunderstood you. Do you want to just clarify?
<20:07>
Do you want to just clarify for Americans that you don’t want people doing that?
<21:50>
But just to clarify that, sir, you’re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?
<22:11>
Some doctors felt they needed to clarify that after your comment.
<22:18>
No, sir. I wasn’t here yesterday.
<22:38>
I wasn’t there yesterday.
<22:40>
No, sir.
