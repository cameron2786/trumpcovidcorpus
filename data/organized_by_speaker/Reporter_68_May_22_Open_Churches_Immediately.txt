Dr. Birx, last week, or I’m sorry, two weeks ago, you and the vice president <inaudible 00:25:39> you wanted 100% of nursing home, residents and staff, tested within two weeks. Most states <inaudible 00:25:45> some two weeks later haven’t even started to try, saying it’s impractical and infeasible. Are you disappointed? Also what are the consequences of that inaction?

Following up on the president’s announcement regarding places of worship, deeming them essential and then having them all reopen. What guidelines and encouragement do you have for pastors, rabbis and imams as they prepare to reopen? Is that appropriate nationwide right now? What precautions do they need to follow if they are going to reopen their houses of worship?
