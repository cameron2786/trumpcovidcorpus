One for the vice president and one for you. Vice president Pence we’re talking about those self swab tests. When will this be available? They said this week, but do you know which day and do you know where they’re going?

I have a question for you. I just want to get clarity on this. If we get to next week you’re deciding what to do with these guidelines, whether to ease them or reinstate them for another 15 days. Will you follow the advice of Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci if they say you should maintain it for to more weeks?
